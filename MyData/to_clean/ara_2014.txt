          Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training, operations
          and research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis publications bear
          a triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with a dot at the centre. Meta-
          phorically, the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk analysis processes and its orienta-
          tion towards an appropriate operational response. The triangle is a symbol of ideal proportions
          and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive analysis.
          The dot at the centre represents the intelligence factor and the focal point where informa-
          tion from diverse sources converges to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical
          products. Thus, Frontex risk analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable ba-
          sis for its operational activities.

relates to fraudulently obtained visas, which
raise particular challenges for first-line offic-
ers to detect, especially given linguistic dif-
ferences and the fact that migrants are not
required to cross the external border of the
Member State that issued the visa. Some of
these issues will be addressed by the Visa In-

its staggered roll-out by the end of 2014.

Nearly 70% of the migrants who had entered
illegally through the Eastern Aegean Sea were
detected on the islands after their crossing.
Detections also occurred in the Ionian Sea
while migrants were trying to reach Italy.

At the beginning of 2013, most migrants cross-
ing the Eastern Aegean Sea were Afghans, but
gradually Syrians have become the main na-
tionality reported for illegal border-crossing.

              Analysis of Eurodac hits data for 2012

              The Eurodac statistics are based on records of (1) fingerprints from all individuals aged
              14 years or over who have made applications for asylum in the Member States (cat-
              egory 1), (2) fingerprints of persons who were apprehended when crossing a Mem-
              ber States external border irregularly (category 2), or (3) persons who were found
              illegally present on the territory of a Member State (in case the competent authori-
              ties consider it necessary to check a potential prior asylum application) (category 3).

              In 2012, a total of 34.4% of all multiple applications were local hits* (down from
              38.6% in 2011). In a number of Member States (Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech
              Republic, Spain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, the UK) this fig-
              ure even exceeds 50%. In the case of Belgium, local hits accounted for 10 037 of the
              14 883 applications (67.4%) and in Cyprus local hits accounted for 139 of the 148 ap-
              plications (93.9%).

              Foreign hits** give an indication of the secondary movements of asylum seekers in
              the EU. As in previous years, the statistics confirm that the secondary movements
              witnessed do not necessarily follow the logical routes between neighbouring Mem-
              ber States. For instance, France continued to receive the highest number of foreign
              hits from asylum seekers who previously lodged an application in Poland (2 498).
              Germany and Switzerland received a high number of asylum seekers who had pre-
              viously lodged an application in Sweden (2 567 and 1 050, respectively). The statis-
              tics show, as in previous years, that foreign hits are not a one-way street from the
              countries with an external land border or those bordering the Mediterranean to the
              more northerly Member States.

              When comparing 2012 with 2011 an increase from 21% to 65.3% can be observed in
              the number of cases of persons apprehended in connection with an irregular bor-
              der-crossing who later decide to lodge an asylum claim. This reflects an increase in
              absolute terms from 7 384 in 2011 to 17 319 in 2012.

              The majority of those who entered the EU illegally via Italy and moved on, travelled
              to Switzerland (2 978), Germany (1 359) or Sweden (881). Those who moved on after
              having entered illegally via Greece mainly went to Germany (2 168), Sweden (1 612)
              or Austria (1 216). Of those entering via Spain, most moved on to either France (410),
              Germany (284), Belgium (259) or Switzerland (242), while those who moved on after
              having had their fingerprints taken in Hungary mainly moved on to the neighbour-
              ing countries of Germany (61) or Austria (59).
              * Local hits are cases where a person making an asylum application in a Member State is discovered to have
                 previously applied for asylum in the same Member State.

              * Foreign hits are cases where a person making an asylum application in a Member State is discovered to
                 have previously applied for asylum or detected for illegal border-crossing in another Member State.
