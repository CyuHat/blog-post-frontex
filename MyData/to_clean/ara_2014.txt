Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training, operations 
and research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis publications bear 
a triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with a dot at the centre. Meta-
phorically, the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk analysis processes and its orienta-
tion towards an appropriate operational response. The triangle is a symbol of ideal proportions 
and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive analysis. 
The dot at the centre represents the intelligence factor and the focal point where informa-
tion from diverse sources converges to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical 
products. Thus, Frontex risk analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable ba-
sis for its operational activities.

Executive summary
 arrivals in 2012 showed a steady trend of +2% 
compared to 2011. The UK and Germany are 
the two Member States reporting the larg-
est number of extra-EU arrivals, each re-
porting more than 20 million. The main two 
airports with the largest number of depar-
tures to the EU in 2012 were the Turkish air-
ports of Istanbul Atatürk (IST) and Antalya 
Airport (AYT), which reached around 6 mil-
lion passengers during the year.
At the land border, although data are limited, 
it can be assessed that between 2009 and 
2013, passenger flows increased more rapidly 
at the land border than at the air border in 
the wake of visa liberalisation for the West-
ern Balkan countries and the implementa-
tion of local border traffic agreements. It is 
now assumed that there are more passen-
gers crossing at the land border than at the 
air border.
Refusals of entry and document fraud
According to the Schengen Borders Code, 
third countries nationals arriving at the ex-
ternal borders may be refused entry into the 
EU if not fulfilling all the entry conditions. Re-
fusals of entry rose by 11% between 2012 and 
2013, to 128 902. While most refusals of en-
try are reported from the land and air bor-
ders, in line with the distribution of passenger 
flows, the long-term trend is an increase at 
the land border due to increasing passenger 
flow. At the EU level, Russians ranked first 
for refusals of entry, followed by Ukrainians 
and Albanians.
The Eastern land border saw a large in-
crease in refusals of entry issued to Russians 
of Chechen origin at the Polish-Belarusian 
land border between March and August 2013. 
Frontex Annual Risk Analysis 2014 presents 
a European summary of trends and devel-
opments along the external borders of the 
Member States of the EU. It focuses on de-
scribing current challenges that are likely to 
impact on operations coordinated along the 
external borders. It presents the latest update 
regarding the situation before the border, at 
the border and after the border.
Before the border
Data on visa issuance are not yet available 
for 2013, but the European Commission has 
released the data for 2012. In 2012, a total of 
14 250 595 short-term uniform visas were is-
sued, representing an increase of 13% com-
pared to 2011, and a 51% increase compared 
to 2009, when 9 420 896 short-term uni-
form visas were issued. Most of the visas 
(59%) were issued in just three countries: the 
Russian Federation, which alone accounted 
for 42% of all visas issued in 2012, with nearly 
6 million visas, as well as Ukraine (1.3 million, 
9%) and China (1.25 million, 8%).
At the border
Passengers
Passenger flow is an indicator of the volume 
of checks that border guards have to perform. 
However, at European level, there is no sys-
tematic reporting on passenger flows by BCP, 
border section or as a total for the EU external 
borders. At the air border, data from Eurostat 
on extra-EU arrivals are the best approxi-
mation of the flow of passengers. At the air 
border, Eurostat data showed that intra-EU 
arrivals (460 million) were approximately four 
times larger than extra-EU arrivals (125 mil-
lion) at main EU airports in 2012. Extra-EU

The migrants showed up without visas and 
then applied for asylum. Later on, they also 
applied for asylum in Germany.
In the Western Balkans, visa liberalisation 
granted to citizens of Serbia, Montenegro, 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Albania in-
creased both the passenger flow and the 
number of refusals of entry. Refusals of en-
try issued to nationals of the Western Balkan 
countries accounted for 18% of all refusals in 
the EU in 2013, while this share was only 9% 
back in 2010, i.e. before visa liberalisation. 
Thus, visa liberalisation resulted in more pas-
sengers checked at the borders. At the same 
time, passengers no longer requesting a visa 
were no longer screened by consulate au-
thorities, thus increasing the responsibilities 
of the border-control authorities, which are 
now the only authorities to identify travel-
lers who do not meet the criteria for travel-
ling in the EU for a period of three months 
within a six-month period, as laid down in 
the legislation.
In 2013, there were around 9 800 detec-
tions of migrants using document fraud to 
illegally enter the EU or Schengen area. The 
use of fraudulently obtained (rather than 
forged) documents is becoming an increas-
ingly common modus operandi at the border. 
This is because modern documents are get-
ting more and more difficult to forge or re-
produce. Indeed, detections of fraudulently 
obtained passports doubled in 2013 in com-
parison to 2012.
Illegal border-crossing
Detections of illegal border-crossing along 
the EUs external borders sharply increased 
between 2012 and 2013, from approximately 
72  500 to 107  000, which represents an 
annual increase of 48%. While the annual 
increase is significant, the 2013 level is com-
parable to the totals reported by Mem-
ber States in 2009 and 2010 (104 600 and 
104 000, respectively), and is still lower than 
the total reported during the Arab Spring in 
2011 (141 000). Apart from this rising trend, 
2013 was characterised by three phenom-
ena: a large increase in illegal border-cross-
ings by Syrians, subsequently applying for 
asylum, on the Eastern Mediterranean route 
and in the Central Mediterranean; a steady 
flow of migrants departing from North Af-
rica (Libya and Egypt) putting their life at risk 
to cross the Mediterranean Sea; and a sharp 
increase, mostly in January-June, in detec-
tions reported by Hungary at its land bor-
der with Serbia.
Most detections of illegal border-crossing 
were of Syrians, Eritreans, Afghans and Al-
banians, who together accounted for 52% of 
total detections (or 55 400). Syrians alone 
(25 500) represented almost a quarter of the 
total. Their detections at the EU border tri-
pled between 2012 and 2013, reflecting the 
dire situation in Syria and the desperate plight 
of Syrian refugees. Syrians were by far the 
most common nationality to request inter-
national protection with 50 096 applications 
reported to the Frontex by Member States. 
This is nearly twice as much as the already 
very high number of applications submitted

by Syrians in 2012 and represented a signifi-
cant increase in numbers for the EU. 
In the Central Mediterranean area detec-
tions were low in the first quarter of 2013, 
but gradually increased starting from the 
second quarter to reach a peak in the third. 
By the end of the year, the annual total was 
40 304 detections of illegal border-crossings. 
Most boats departed from Libya, where fa-
cilitators take advantage of weak govern-
ment controls. Many migrants also departed 
from Egypt.
On the Eastern Mediterranean route, de-
tections (24 800 in 2013) were at the low-
est level reported since 2009, but this route 
still ranked second and accounted for nearly 
a quarter of all detections of illegal border-
crossing to the EU. Compared to 2011 and 
2012, the areas of detections also consider-
ably changed and detections in the Eastern 
Aegean Sea were the largest, followed by de-
tections along the land border between Bul-
garia and Turkey.
Detections of illegal border-crossing strongly 
increased on the Western Balkan route, from 
about 6 400 in 2012 to 19 500 in 2013. Most 
of the detections were reported in Febru-
ary-July 2013 at the Hungarian-Serbian land 
border. Migrants detected in that period for 
illegal-border crossing immediately applied 
for asylum and subsequently absconded 
to continue their journey to other Mem-
ber States.
In the Western Mediterranean area and on 
the Western African route, detections of ille-
gal border-crossing remained fairly stable in 
2013, with 6 800 and nearly 300 detections 
respectively. In the Western Mediterranean, 
nearly two-thirds of the detections were re-
ported at the land border in Ceuta and Me-
lilla. This is associated with more effective 
prevention of departures at sea by the Mo-
roccan authorities and enhanced prevention 
measures in the Mediterranean Sea, includ-
ing the EPN JO Indalo. Several times in 2013, 
the Spanish authorities warned of the per-
manent threat of migration to Melilla.
At the eastern land border, detections of ille-
gal border-crossing remained at a low level, 
at 1 300, or 1.2% of the EU total.
After the border
In 2013, there were about 345 000 detections 
of illegal stay in the EU, which represented a 
generally stable trend compared to the pre-
vious year. This is consistent with a stable, if 
slightly declining long-term trend over the 
past five years.
Based on the Frontex Risk Analysis Network 
(FRAN) data for 2013, the number of asylum 
applications submitted in the EU continued to 
increase. Preliminary data indicate an over-
all increase of about 28%, totalling 353 991 
applications in 2013. Syrians were by far the 
most common nationality to request inter-
national protection, nearly double the already 
very high number of applications submitted in 
2012. More than two-thirds of all Syrian ap-
plications were submitted in Sweden, Ger-
many and Bulgaria.
Between 2012 and 2013, detections of facilita-
tors decreased by 11%, totalling about 6 900 
in 2013. This decrease may be in part due to 
a widespread shift towards the abuse of legal 
channels and using document fraud to enter 
the EU, which allows facilitators to operate 
remotely and inconspicuously rather than ac-
company migrants.
In 2013, there was a steady trend of about 
159 000 third-country nationals effectively 
returned to third countries. This total does 
not include readmissions between Member 
States. As in 2012, the UK and Greece were 
the Member States conducting the largest 
number of returns.

Conclusions  Outlook
The best forecasts  those likely to material-
ise and have a direct bearing on the situation 
at the external border  spell an increased 
workload for border-control authorities as 
of October 2014, when all Schengen Mem-
ber States will be required to be able to carry 
out VIS fingerprint verifications at all bor-
der-crossing points (BCPs) and also to is-
sue VIS visas with biometrics at the border 
when necessary. This additional mandatory 
task will come in addition to increased pas-
sengers flows, in particular at the land bor-
der, due to visa liberalisation and a general 
increase in peoples mobility worldwide. In-
creased workload and responsibilities for 
border-control authorities come at a time 
of budget constraints.
Looking ahead, everything points to a height-
ened likelihood of large numbers of illegal bor-
der-crossings into the EU and an increased 
number of migrants in need of assistance 
from search and rescue operations but also 
in terms of provision of international protec-
tion, in particular in the southern section of 
the external border, on the Eastern Mediter-
ranean route and the Central Mediterranean 
route. Many migrants who crossed illegally 
are expected to continue making secondary 
movements within the EU.
Most risks associated with document fraud 
were assessed as high. Indeed, document 
fraudsters not only undermine border secu-
rity but also the internal security of the EU. 
These risks are common to nearly all Member 
States, as they are associated with passenger 
flows and border checks, which are a spe-
cific expertise of border-control authorities. 
Most cases of fraud are expected to involve 
EU travel documents and there are indica-
tions of a shift away from the use of pass-
ports towards less sophisticated documents 
such as ID cards and residence permits.
The risks associated with the abuse of legal 
channels are often assessed as high as they 
are common and widespread phenomena. 
Although no reliable measurements exist in 
this respect, such abuse probably represents 
the easiest and most common modus operandi 
used by persons staying illegally in the EU.

1. Introduction
The Frontex Annual Risk Analysis (ARA) 2014 
presents a European summary of trends and 
developments along the external borders of 
the Member States of the EU. This analysis 
is based on information provided to Frontex 
by the EU Member States and Schengen As-
sociated countries throughout 2013, as well 
as information collected during Frontex Joint 
Operations and from open sources.
The analysis starts with an overview of the 
situation before the border based on data for 
Schengen uniform visas. It then looks at the 
situation along the external border, based on 
trends in regular passenger flows, detections 
of illegal border-crossing, clandestine entries 
and refusals of entry. Finally, the report pro-
vides an update on the situation regarding 
persons staying illegally in the EU and third-
country nationals returned.
Frontex operational activities aim at strength-
ening border security by ensuring the coor-
dination of Member States actions in the 
implementation of Community measures 
relating to the management of the external 
borders. The coordination of operational ac-
tivities also contributes to better allocation 
of Member States resources and protection 
of the area of freedom, security and justice.
The ARA 2014 concentrates on the current 
scope of Frontex operational activities, which 
focus on irregular migration at the external 
borders of EU Member States and Schengen 
Associated Countries. In line with the con-
cept of integrated border management (IBM), 
border management should not be limited to 
controlling illegal migration but also cover 
threats to the EU internal security. Thus a full 
section is dedicated to the analysis of cross-
border crime.
The Frontex Risk Analysis Unit (RAU) would 
like to express its gratitude to all members of 
the Frontex Risk Analysis Network (FRAN) in 
Member States for their efforts in providing 
data and information, as well as to Europol, 
European Asylum Support Office (EASO) and 
the European Commission, which have con-
tributed to the ARA 2014, and to all Fron-
tex colleagues involved in the preparation 
of this report.

Data exchange
A coherent and full analysis of the risks affect-
ing security at the external borders requires, 
above all, the adoption of common indica-
tors. Consistent monitoring of these indica-
tors will then allow effective measures to be 
taken on the ground. The analysis will need 
to identify the risks that arise at the exter-
nal borders themselves and those that arise 
in third countries.
The backbone of the ARA 2014 is the monthly 
statistics exchanged between Member States 
within the framework of the Frontex Risk 
Analysis Network (FRAN). This regular data-
exchange exercise was launched in Septem-
ber 2007 and then refined in 2008. Thanks 
to the FRAN members efforts, a much larger 
statistical coverage was achieved in 2011, fo-
cusing on seven key indicators: (1) detections 
of illegal border-crossing, (2) refusals of entry, 
(3) detections of illegal stay, (4) asylum appli-
cations, (5) detections of facilitators, (6) de-
tections of forged documents and (7) return 
decisions and effective returns.
Following the closing of the Centre for In-
formation, Discussion and Exchange on 
the Crossing of Frontiers and Immigra-
tion (CIREFI) working group in April 2010, 
most of its mandate, in particular the as-
pects concerning the exchange of data, were 
transferred to the FRAN. Most indicators 
monitored by CIREFI had already been part 
of the monthly data exchange among FRAN 
members and only the statistics on returns 
had to be added as the seventh indicator of 
the regular data exchange as of January 2011.
In 2011, the original FRAN indicator on forged 
documents was updated to enable the anal-
ysis of complex modi operandi. Following a 
successful pilot study, the European Un-
ion Document-Fraud Risk Analysis Net-
work (EDF-RAN) was formed in early 2012 
to oversee the exchange of a much more 
comprehensive and detailed indicator on doc-
ument fraud, including the abuse of genuine 
documents.
Member States were not requested to answer 
specific questions in support of this anal-
ysis. Rather, bi-monthly analytical reports 
and incident reports of Member States rou-
tinely collected within the FRAN and Mem-
ber States contributions to several Tailored 
Risk Analyses produced in 2013 were used 
as important sources of information, espe-
cially as regards the analysis of routes and 
modi operandi.
Open-source information was also effectively 
exploited, especially in identifying the main 
push and pull factors for irregular migration to 
the EU. Among others, these sources included

2. Methodology
11 of 80
reports issued by government agencies, in-
ternational and non-governmental organisa-
tions, as well as official EU reports, such as 
the European Commissions reports on third 
countries, and mainstream news agencies.
In addition, Frontex organised an Annual An-
alytical Review to consolidate the risk anal-
yses presented in the FRAN Quarterlies for 
2013 and also to gather knowledge on likely 
risks of irregular migration at the EUs exter-
nal borders. Participants of the FRAN were 
invited in January 2014 to review and com-
ment on the risks identified at the external 
borders during a one-day exercise.
The data exchange was overseen by Frontex 
involving national border-control authorities. 
Data were categorised by border type (land, 
air and sea) and those on land borders were 
additionally categorised by border section 
with neighbouring third countries.
The data exchanged within the FRAN are 
compiled and analysed on a quarterly basis. 
Priority is given to the use of data for man-
agement purposes and to its fast sharing 
among Member State border-control au-
thorities. Member States data processed by 
Frontex are not treated as official statistics 
and thus may occasionally vary from those 
officially published by national authorities.
Throughout 2013, some FRAN members per-
formed backdated updates of their 2012 sta-
tistics. These updates have been accounted 
for in this document and so some data pre-
sented herein may differ from the data pre-
sented a year ago in the Annual Risk Analysis 
2013.
External borders refer to the borders between 
Member States and third countries. The bor-
ders, if any, between the Schengen Associated 
Countries (Norway, Iceland and Switzerland) 
and third countries are also considered as 
external borders. The borders between the 
Schengen Associated Countries and Schen-
gen Member States are considered as internal 
borders. For indicators on detections of facil-
itators, illegal stay and asylum, statistics are 
also reported for detections at the land bor-
ders, if any, between the Schengen Member 
States and Member States not yet part of the 
Schengen area (Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia, 
Cyprus) or Member States that have opted-
out from Schengen (the UK, Ireland), so that 
a total for EU Member States and Schen-
gen Associated Countries as a whole can be 
presented. It was not possible to make this 
distinction for air and sea borders because 
Member States do not habitually differenti-
ate between extra-EU and intra-EU air and 
sea connections but tend to aggregate data 
for all arrivals per airport.
Quality of available data
Consistent with other law-enforcement in-
dicators, variations in administrative data 
related to border control depend on several 
factors. In this case, the number of detections 
of illegal border-crossing and refusals of en-
try are both functions of the amount of ef-
fort spent detecting irregular migrants and 
the actual flow of irregular migrants to the 
EU. For example, increased detections of il-
legal border-crossing might be due to a real 
increase in the flow of irregular migrants 
or may in fact be an outcome of more re-
sources made available to detect them. In 
exceptional cases, increased resources may 
produce a rise in reported detections while 
effectively masking an actual decrease in the 
flow of migrants, resulting from a strong de-
terrent effect.
Conservative estimates of the number of 
irregular migrants within the EU vary be-
tween 3 and 6 million, according to the re-
sults of Clandestino, an EU-sponsored project 
implemented by the International Centre 
for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD). 
Other estimates put the figure of irregular 
Frontex · annual risk analysis 2014
12 of 80
migrants at 8 million, of which 80% are stay-
ing inside the Schengen area, half of them 
having originally entered it legally. However, 
there is currently no estimate of the annual 
flow of persons entering and staying ille-
gally in the EU.
Information on national-level resources for 
border-control authorities and their alloca-
tion is currently only partially known. These 
data are provided by Member States them-
selves either within the Schengen evaluation 
mechanism or within the External Borders 
Fund (EBF) reporting. Without systematic 
and reliable information on resources allo-
cated to border control and without esti-
mates of irregular migration flows, it is not 
possible to assess the performance and im-
pact of the border controls put in place and 
the analyses of the situation at the EUs ex-
ternal borders are limited to descriptive sta-
tistics of the administrative data provided by 
Member States.
As highlighted in the Schengen Catalogue, 
variation in regular passenger flow is an im-
portant factor to be taken into account in 
the allocation of border-control resources. 
However, regular flows of passengers across 
the EUs external borders are currently not 
recorded systematically. Some approxima-
tions have been arrived at by using availa-
ble Eurostat data on passenger flows at the 
air borders and relying on publicly availa-
ble data on passenger flows across the land 
borders received from national border-con-
trol authorities.
Data on the number of EU visas issued and 
their places of issue would improve the char-
acterisation of third-country passenger flows. 
However, this information, which is collected 
within the Councils Visa Working Party and 
published by the European Commission, is 
not yet available for 2013. For the purpose 
of the ARA, data from 2008 to 2012 are dis-
cussed as an introduction to the general sit-
uation at the borders.
Application of the Common Integrated 
Risk Analysis Model (CIRAM)
A key development in the CIRAM 2.0 up-
date released in 2011 was the adoption of a 
management approach to risk analysis that 
defines risk as a function of the threat, vul-
nerability and impact. Such an approach en-
deavours to reflect the spirit of the Schengen 
Borders Code and the Frontex Regulation, 
both of which emphasise risk analysis as a 
key tool in ensuring the optimal allocation of 
resources within the constraints of budget, 
staff and efficiency of equipment.

3.1. Before the border
Issuance of Schengen visas
Visa policy acts as a form of pre-entry pro-
cedure to ensure that third-country nation-
als comply with entry requirements, which 
helps to prevent irregular migration. In this 
respect, particularly important in prevent-
ing subsequent illegal stay is the role of con-
sular offices in third countries determining 
whether a third-country national should be 
granted a visa or not. Member States have 
introduced a variety of specific measures in 
their visa-issuing procedures to tackle irregu-
lar migration, which includes the assessment 
of the willingness to return, the training of 
personnel at embassies and consulates, and 
cooperation and information exchange with 
other entities and Member States. Other 
preventive measures include the use of bi-
ometric data in the visa application process 
and the identification of specific categories 
of migrants who might misuse their visa 
and raising the awareness in third countries 
about the consequences of making fraudu-
lent applications.
The Community Code on Visas, which en-
tered into force in April 2010, sets out the 
common requirements for issuing transit 
and short-term visas to enter the territory 
of Member States. There are currently over 
100 nationalities that require a visa to enter 
the EU, covering more than 80% of non-EU 
population of the world. Nevertheless, about 
1 billion nationals from approximately 40 third 
countries do not require an EU visa. These in-
clude Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand 
and the USA. The list of countries whose na-
tionals require a visa to travel to the UK or 
Ireland differs slightly from other EU Member 
States. As indicated in the Visa Code, statis-
tical data are an important means of moni-
toring migratory movements and can serve 
as an efficient management tool.
Recent changes to Schengen regulations 
have seen a simplification of the visa regime. 
Schengen Member States now issue only 
three types of visa: (1) airport transit visa (A) 
 valid only for airport transit, does not en-
title the holder to leave the transit zone of 
the airport; (2) short-stay visa (C)  valid for 
stays of no more than 90 days per period of 
180 days; (3) national long-stay visas (D) and 
residence permits. The data include visas is-
sued by the Schengen Associated Countries 
(Iceland, Norway and Switzerland), but do 
not include those issued by Croatia, Cyprus, 
Romania and Bulgaria*, which have not yet 
joined the Schengen area, nor visas issued 
by the UK and Ireland, which are not part of 
the Schengen area.
Data on visa issuance by Member States and 
third countries of issuance are not yet avail-
able for 2013, but the European Commis-
sion, through its Directorate-General Home 
Affairs, has released the data for 2012. Visa 
* Data on visa issued by 
Cyprus, Romania and 
Bulgaria were reported 
by the Commission until 
2011, but stopped to be 
reported as of 2012.

3. Situation at the external borders
 Information System (VIS) data are collected 
on the basis of the place of application rather 
than the citizenship of the visa applicant. 
Thus, for instance, applications made in the 
Russian Federation do not necessarily rep-
resent only Russian nationals. However, for 
the purpose of the following overview, the 
country where the visas were delivered was 
used as the most suitable approximation of 
the visas issued to citizens of that country. 
Visas broken down by nationalities are avail-
able at the national level, where they can be 
used for operational purposes.
In 2012, a total of 14 250 595 short-term uni-
form visas were issued, representing an in-
crease of 13% compared to 2011 and a 51% 
increase compared to 2009, when 9 420 896 
short-term uniform visas were issued. This in-
crease is even more remarkable taking into 
account that in 2010 and 2011, five Western 
Balkan countries (the former Yugoslav Repub-
lic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Alba-
nia, Bosnia and Herzegovina) saw their visa 
requirements to enter the EU lifted, leading 
to a landslide decrease in the number of visas 
issued in these five countries from 688 531 in 
2009 to only 13 893 in 2012.
In fact, most of the visas (59%) were issued 
in just three countries: the Russian Federa-
tion, which alone accounted for 42% of all vi-
sas issued in 2012, with nearly 6 million visas, 
as well as Ukraine (1.3 million, 9%) and China 
(1.25 million, 8%). There are, however, impor-
tant differences between these three coun-
tries in the purpose of travel and frequency of 
trips. Multiple-entry visas accounted for 49% 
of all visas issued in the Russian Federation 
but only for 13% of those issued in China. In-
deed, many Chinese applied for short-term 
visas as part of their tourist package in the 
EU. According to the World Tourism Organ-
ization, China is now the leading nation in 
terms of tourism expenditure worldwide and 
this trend will further consolidate.
Consistent with the countries where visas 
were most issued, seven out of ten Schengen 
states consulates receiving most short-term 
visas applications in 2012 were in the Rus-
sian Federation, and the remaining three in 
Ukraine, China and Belarus. These ten con-
sulates received 31% of all Schengen visa 
applications.
In 2012, the Schengen Member States report-

(1.7 million), Spain (1.6 million), Italy (1.6 million) 
and Finland (1.4 million, mainly in the Rus-
sian Federation). These five Member States 
issued 60% of all uniform short-term visas.
Also in 2012, 138  144 short-term visas were 
issued at BCPs. The BCPs with most visas 
issued were the seaports of Rotterdam, Bar-
celona and Antwerp.
Table 2 shows the number of visas issued by 
the top ten Member States in specific third 
countries. The table clearly illustrates a large 
increase in the number of visas issued in the 
Russian Federation by several Member States.
Visa refusals
The consulate in charge of dealing with visa 
applications assesses the applicants compli-
ance with entry conditions, the risk of irreg-
ular immigration, the applicants intention to 
leave the territory of the Member State be-
fore the expiry of the visa and the risk the 
applicant presenting a risk to the security or 
public health of the Member State.
As a result, some visa applications are refused. 
There are no data on the reasons for refusal of 
visa applications, but the overall visa refusal 
rate may be determined per third country 
where visas are issued. Combined with addi-
tional information and tailored to operational 
needs, the rate of visa refusals in consulates 
may be used by border-control authorities to 
determine the countries of origin presenting 
the highest risk of irregular migration.
On average, 4.8% of C visa applications were 
refused in 2012 (down from 5.5% in 2011). There 
are, however, important differences between 
Member States (Belgium refuses 16% of ap-
plications, while Lithuania and Latvia refuse 
around 1% each) and between third countries 
(while in Algeria 27% and in Iran 18% of ap-
plications are refused, the refusal rate in the 
Russian Federation, Belarus and South Af-
rica is below 1%).
Regarding the risk of clandestine entry, 
with no reliable measurements in place, 
the extent of the phenomenon is probably 
underestimated.

At the borders, border controls consist of 
border checks and border surveillance. Bor-
der checks means the checks carried out at 
border crossing points, to ensure that per-
sons, including their means of transport and 
the objects in their possession, may be au-
thorised to enter the territory of the Member 
States or authorised to leave it. EU nationals 
are subject to minimal checks, while third-
country nationals, whether they require a 
visa or not, are subject to thorough checks. 
Border checks represent a significant part of 
the work of border control authorities and 
are directly linked to the flow of passengers.
It is during border checks that a decision, 
based on a procedure set in the Schengen 
Borders Code, may be taken by border con-
trol authorities to refuse entry to third-coun-
try nationals. It is also during border checks 
that document fraud is detected. These two 
aspects, trends in refusals of entry and docu-
ment frauds, are analysed based on data sent 
by Member States to the FRAN.
Border surveillance means the surveillance 
of borders between border crossing points 
and the surveillance of border crossing points 
outside the fixed opening hours, in order to 
prevent persons from circumventing border 
checks. It is during surveillance that border 
control authorities detected illegal border-
crossings. These detections are the most vis-
ible part of border controls and the ones that 
are often reported by the media.
Detections of migrants trying to avoid bor-
der checks by hiding in vehicles is assimilated 
as a particular attempt to circumvent border 
checks and referred to as clandestine entries. 
As a corollary to strengthened surveillance 
and checks along the external borders, bor-
der-control authorities are confronted with 
the detection of cross-border crimes such as 
trafficking in human beings, drug trafficking 
and the smuggling of excise goods, as well as 
with detections of cross-border crime com-
mitted on exit, like the smuggling of stolen 
assets, in particular vehicles. Thus, the anal-
ysis of cross-border crime forms an integral 
part of the description of the situation along 
the external borders.

they are often the first authorities asylum

3.2. At the border
3.2.1. Regular passenger flow
Passenger flow is an indicator of the volume 
of checks that border guards have to perform, 
relative to the number of border guards. Cit-
izens enjoying free movement are subject to 
minimum checks, while third-country nation-
als, whether they require visas or not, are sub-
ject to more thorough checks, as defined by 
the Schengen Borders Code. Hence, the na-
ture and volume of passenger flow determine 
to a large extent the planning and allocation 
of resources for border checks.
Passenger flow data also prove useful in an-
alysing indicators of irregular migration, in 
particular refusals of entry and detections 
of document fraud. Indeed, differences in 
the rates of refusals of entry to overall pas-
senger flow may help identify best practices 
and eventually ensure that checks are per-
formed in a harmonised way across the BCPs 
of the EU. Similarly, detections of document 
fraud are most effectively analysed in con-
nection with passenger flows and detection 
rates, rather than the sheer number of de-
tections, and provide the most useful tool for 
assessing border checks and flows of docu-
ment fraudsters.
At European level there is no systematic re-
porting on passenger flows by BCP, border 
section or as a total for the EUs external bor-
der. Member States reported data on passen-
ger flow in the framework of the European 
Border Fund (EBF), showing a total of 701 
million crossings (entries and exits) in 2011, 
excluding the UK and Ireland, which do not 
participate in the EBF, and including cross-
ings between non-Schengen and Schengen 
Member States (France-UK, Belgium-UK, Ro-
mania-Hungary). This total consists of 384 
million passengers crossing at the air border, 
233 million at the land border and 84 million 
at the sea border. However, the total for the 
air border represents all passenger flows, in-
cluding passengers from EU countries. Euro-
stat provides data on air passenger flows (EU 
nationals and third-country nationals) coming 
only from third countries, which totalled 125 
million in 2011, including the UK and Ireland. 
The EBF total for sea border-crossing appears 
very large, but probably also includes cross-
ings between Member States. Given these 
uncertainties, it is difficult to estimate the 
EU total passenger flow from third coun-
tries that could usefully be analysed against 
the number of refusals of entry and detec-
tions of fraudulent documents.
As traveller numbers continue to rise, it can 
be expected that the current infrastructure 
at BCPs will have greater difficulties in deal-
ing with increased throughput. The dual ob-
jective of facilitating travel and maintaining 
security requires the introduction of new ap-
proaches and innovative solutions to border 
management.

Air borders
At the air border, Member State border-con-
trol authorities do not collect data on pas-
sengers going through border checks in a 
systematic way. Some Member States have 
systems in place that record the number and 
nationality of the passengers in detail, but 
most Member States do not directly col-
lect detailed statistics but rely on informa-
tion provided by air carriers. One of the main 
difficulties in estimating the flow of passen-
gers through the external borders at the air 
border is that passengers coming from third 
countries and passengers coming from non-
Schengen Member States go through the 
same booths and so there is no way to dis-
tinguish the two flows.
At the air border, data from Eurostat on ex-
tra-EU arrivals are the best approximation of 
the flow of passengers, but this flow does not 
correspond to the total flow of passengers 
going through border checks as it does not 
take into account the flow between Schen-
gen and non-Schengen Member States.
Eurostat data showed that intra-EU arrivals 
(460 million) were approximately four times 
larger than extra-EU arrivals (125 million) at 
main EU airports in 2012. Extra-EU arrivals 
in 2012 showed a steady trend of +2% com-
pared to 2011. The UK and Germany are the 
two Member States reporting the largest 
number of extra-EU arrivals, each reporting 
more than 20 million. France follows with 
18 million extra-EU arrivals. Together, the 
UK, Germany and France account for 61% of 
all extra-EU arrivals.
In 2012, the largest numbers of extra-EU ar-
rivals were reported from London Heathrow 
(LHR) with more than 18 million passengers, 
followed by Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG)

Extra-EU arrivals by air demonstrate a clear 
seasonal pattern with many more passengers 
arriving in the summer holiday period. In the 
light of the total 2012 data for 27 EU Member 
States, during the first months of the year the 
passenger air flow is around 11 million pas-
sengers per month, followed by a steady in-
crease in the number of passengers during 
the months of June and July, reaching a peak 
in August, with approximately 17 million pas-
sengers. After this time, the number of pas-
sengers starts to gradually fall off over the 
subsequent months, reaching its low in No-
vember and December, at around 10 million 
passengers. There is thus an increase of nearly 
70% between the month with the smallest 
flow and the month with the largest flow.
Third-country airports of departure to 
the EU
The main two airports with the largest num-
ber of departures to the EU in 2012 were 
the Turkish airports of Istanbul Atatürk (IST) 
and Antalya Airport (AYT), which reached 
around 6 million passengers during the year. 
Dubai International Airport (DXB), with an 
increasing trend since 2009, and New York 
John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) 
also ranked top reaching more than 5 million 
passengers in 2012. Other airports located 
in countries such as the Russian Federa-
tion, Israel and the USA accounted for a sig-
nificant volume of passengers in 2012. The 
flights departing from the Turkish airports 
and from the USA had the airports of Düs-
seldorf (DUS) and London Heathrow (LHR) 
as main destinations.
The main increases in regular air 
passenger flow between 2011 and 2012
The route with the highest increase from 2011 
to 2012 on extra-EU flights runs from Ukraine 
to Italy, with a sharp increase of passengers 
on the route between the Ukrainian airport 
in Kyiv (KBP) and the Italian airport of Treviso 
(TSF), in the north of Italy (+279%). There was 
also a large increase on the route connecting 
Moscow Vnukovo (VKO) and the Italian air-
port of Federico Fellini International Airport 
(RMI) in Rimini (+138%). Although the total 
number of passengers is relatively low, the 
development of new air routes is important 
to follow because it requires border-control 
authorities to get acquainted with new pas-
senger profiles, including in some cases up-
dating their knowledge on travel documents 
that were not commonly encountered before 
the development of these new routes. Co-
operation with other EU airports with sim-
ilar third-country departure airports speeds 
up the learning process.

Since 2009, the route from Moscow Sherem-
etyevo International Airport (SVO) to Lennart 
Meri Airport in Tallinn (TLL) has also shown a 
continuous growth, with around 46 000 pas-
sengers in 2012, resulting in a 114% increase 
from 2011 to 2012.
Dubai International Airport (DXB) also ranked 
top among the airports with the highest in-
crease in passengers on flights coming to the 
EU. From 2011 to 2012 there were almost three 
times more passengers flying from Dubai to 
Copenhagen Airport (CPH) in Denmark. To a 
lesser extent, the number of passengers fly-
ing from Dubai to Geneva (GVA) also showed 
a strong increase of 89% in 2012.
Land borders
Information available on passenger traffic at 
the external land borders of the EU is scarce. 
Although it appears fundamental to risk anal-
ysis, policy making and resource allocation, 
not all Member States count every traveller 
crossing land borders and the practices for 
counting travellers and vehicles vary consid-
erably among Member States.
The only reliable comparative data available 
come from the SCIFA data collection exercise 
conducted for one week, from 31 August to 
6 September 2009, which offers some evi-
dence of the importance of cross-border flows 
at land borders.* Land BCPs follow air borders 
closely in terms of the total volume of en-
tries and exits. However, between 2009 and 
2013, passenger flows increased more rap-
idly at the land border than at the air border 
in the wake of visa liberalisation for Western 
Balkan countries and the implementation of 
local border traffic agreements. It is now as-
sumed that there are more passengers cross-
ing at the land border than at the air border.
The SCIFA data collection exercise also re-
vealed, at least in 2009, a different compo-
sition of passenger flow at the land and at 
the air border, with a larger proportion of 
third-country nationals requiring thorough 
checks on entry, in line with the Schengen 
Borders Code, at the land border (53% of the 
flow) than at the air border (40%). This var-
iation is likely larger in 2013, representing a 
significant load on the external land borders.
Importantly, the proportion of border-cross-
ings by third-country nationals to the total 
number of entries / exits varies widely among 
Member States. For example, in 2010 in Po-
land this ratio was almost three times greater

than in Hungary, while the estimated vol-
ume of total traffic in these two countries 
was comparable (see Tab. 6).
The SCIFA exercise also concluded that road 
BCPs account for a much larger proportion 
of traveller traffic (around 95% of all border-
crossings) than rail BCPs. It is reasonable to 
assume that there are significant seasonal 
differences in the flows at land BCPs across 
the EU, considering, for example, much larger 
flows during the summer holiday period.
Land BCP check practices and land BCPs 
themselves vary widely. This sets them apart 
from air borders, as airports constitute a con-
trolled environment where practices can be 
more easily standardised. Moreover, the rate 
at which traffic flows across land BCPs are 
determined not only by Member States but 
also by the practices of neighbouring third 
countries. Bilateral cooperation is thus fun-
damental to facilitating transit. Unlike at the 
air border, early warnings at land BCPs are 
rarely available, which limits the ability of bor-
der management authorities to allocate re-
sources in advance. Finally, land borders can 
be subject to massive or emergency flows, 
for which contingency planning is necessary.
Local border traffic agreements
A local border traffic agreement (LBTA) pro-
vides for the issuance of permits entitling 
border residents to cross an external land 
border under the local border traffic regime. 
This must be done in compliance with the rel-
evant provisions of Council Regulation (EC) 
No 1030 / 2002 of 13 June 2002 laying down 
a uniform format for residence permits for 
third-country nationals.
In general, LBTA permits do not include other 
biometric identifiers besides the photograph 
of the holder, although some Member States 
(e.g. Poland and Slovakia) appear to be con-
sidering the option of adding supplementary 
biometrics in the future. In light of the man-
datory introduction of fingerprint checks in 
the VIS at land borders from October 2014, 
a number of questions arise. Assuming that 
visa policy remains the same and the citi-
zens of a number of neighbouring countries 
continue to be visa-required, it remains un-
certain whether LBTA card holders will be ex-
empt from the requirement to provide their 
fingerprints. If so, then it is likely that LBTA 
cards might become more popular, but also 
more targeted by organised criminal groups 
as a way of avoiding the fingerprint check. 
If no, then all Member States national LBTA 
card issuance systems will have to be reor-
ganised to include fingerprints on the card.

3.2.2. Refusals of entry
According to the Schengen Borders Code, 
third countries nationals arriving at the exter-
nal borders may be refused entry into the EU 
if not fulfilling all the entry conditions. There 
are nine reasons to refuse entry and they are 
all listed in the Schengen Borders Code. The 
Schengen Borders Code also describes the 
standard refusal form to be issued to each 
person refused entry into the EU.
Refusals of entry rose by 11% between 2012 and 
2013, to 128 902. While most refusals of entry 
are reported from the land and air borders, in 
line with the distribution of passenger flows, 
the long-term trend is an increase at the land 
border due to increasing passenger flow. At the 
EU level, Russians ranked first for refusals of 
entry, followed by Ukrainians and Albanians.
At the land borders, most refusals of entry 
(more than 50 000) were reported at the 
eastern land borders, in particular at the land 
border between Poland and Belarus. Most 
of these refusals concerned citizens of the 
Russian Federation of Chechen origin who 
applied for asylum after being refused en-
try due to lack of visa. Soon afterwards they 
continued towards Germany, where they ap-
plied for asylum again. Neither Germany nor 
Poland granted them asylum and therefore 
most stayed illegally within the EU. This mo-
dus operandi was mostly reported between 
March and April 2013. However, even after

land border between Poland and Belarus, where they also applied for asylum. Most were of

April 2013, the monthly number of refusals 
of entry to Russians at the Polish-Belarusian 
land border remained larger than in the cor-
responding months of 2012. The reasons be-
hind this sudden and large increase are not 
fully understood. There was no particular se-
curity or political incidents in Chechnya im-
mediately before or during that period, and 
the economic situation, while relatively poor, 
did not change drastically either. This sudden 
flow could have been triggered by rumours 
spreading in Chechnya about Germany grant-
ing asylum to Russians of Chechen origin.
In the Western Balkans, visa liberalisation 
granted to citizens of Serbia, Montenegro, 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia and Albania increased 
both passenger flow and refusals of entry. 
In terms of volume, the increase was much 
stronger at the land border, from 7 146 in 2009 
to 19 275 in 2013, than at the air border, from 
1 109 to 4 431, reflecting the preferred choice 
of transport for most Western Balkan nation-
als travelling to the EU. Refusals of entry to 
Western Balkan country nationals with the 
visa-free status accounted for 20% of all re-
fusals in the EU in 2013, while this proportion 
was only of 13% in 2010, i.e. before visa liber-
alisation. This highlights the increased work-
load of border-control authorities.
3.2.3. Document fraud
Document fraud involving either authentic 
or false documents is an important challenge 
for border control and internal security, as it 
allows migrants in irregular or unlawful sit-
uations not only to enter the territory of a 
Member State, but then also to move freely 
within the Schengen area and to non-Schen-
gen EU Member States.
It is generally recognised that document fraud 
poses significant risks: Individuals assuming 
a bogus identity and operating in the black 
market seriously affect internal security and 
undermine international criminal investiga-
tions, as well as national social systems and 
the ability of any state to effectively manage 
and protect its legitimate communities. Doc-
ument fraud also creates strong links to or-
ganised crime groups (OCGs) and generates 
their proceeds, because modern documents 
require more sophisticated and expensive 
techniques to produce quality forgeries.
Document fraud can involve the use of both 
authentic and false documents and can be 
classified in the following four categories:
False documents:
n  forgeries  previously authentic docu-
ments that have been tampered with or 
falsified;
n  counterfeits  entirely manufactured doc-
uments made to resemble originals
Authentic documents:
n  fraudulently obtained documents  docu-
ments that were issued based on fraudu-
lent applications or supporting documents;
n  impostors  documents being used by an 
unauthorised user (look-alikes).
The abuse of EU passports is of particular 
concern because migrants using them may 
be subject to less rigorous checks at the ex-
ternal border, and because documents may

also be used to access social systems or be 
subsequently reused by other migrants at-
tempting illegal entry. Another major issue 
relates to fraudulently obtained visas, which 
raise particular challenges for first-line offic-
ers to detect, especially given linguistic dif-
ferences and the fact that migrants are not 
required to cross the external border of the 
Member State that issued the visa. Some of 
these issues will be addressed by the Visa In-
formation System (VIS), which will conclude 
its staggered roll-out by the end of 2014.
Modern, sophisticated documents are more 
difficult to falsify or reproduce than docu-
ments issued some years ago. As a result 
there has been a consistent move towards 
the abuse of genuine documents (which do 
not require forgery techniques) either by using 
someone elses document, i.e. acting as im-
postors or by obtaining genuine documents 
based on fraudulent applications. Many ex-
perts suggest that a strengthening of reg-
istration and issuing procedures, coupled 
with more sophisticated and standardised 
breeder documents are needed to overcome 
the growing threat of the abuse of genuine 
documents.
The European Union Document-Fraud 
Risk Analysis Network
To address the need for standardised infor-
mation exchange in the field of detected 
fraudulent documents, the European Un-
ion Document-Fraud Risk Analysis Net-
work (EDF-RAN) was formed in early 2012 
to serve as a platform for information ex-
change among Member States. Overseen 
by Frontex, during 2013 some 29 Member 
States / Schengen Associated Countries met 
to exchange information on several occa-
sions and maintained and developed the de-
tailed and complex monthly data-exchange 
covering all detections of document fraud at 
the external border and on all international 
flights. Depersonalised data on document 
fraudsters were exchanged detailing type of 
document and routes taken.
According to EDF-RAN data, in 2013 there 
were nearly 10 000 detections of migrants 
using fraudulent documents to attempt ille-
gal entry to the EU / Schengen area from third 
countries, which is an increase of 24% com-
pared to the previous year (Fig. 10). Some of 
this increase was due to more countries par-

ticipating in the EDF in 2013 and also proba-
bly because of steadily more consistent and 
well-defined reporting within the framework 
of the EDF-RAN. However, there was also ev-
idence of a significant increase in detections 
of document fraud across the EU, particularly 
in terms of authentic documents.
In 2013, nearly three-quarters of detections 
of document fraud were at the external air, 
rather than sea or land borders.
Detections were clumped among a small 
number or airports which detected very high 
numbers of fraudulent documents. For ex-
ample, the top five airports (Paris Charles de 
Gaulle, Rome Fiumicino, Madrid, Lisbon and 
London Heathrow) reported nearly half of all 
detections at the external air border. At the 
land border, BCPs between Greece and Al-
bania, between Bulgaria and Turkey and be-
tween Ukraine and both Poland and Hungary 
were all significant in terms of detections of 
document fraud.
Modi operandi
Recent years have seen increased detections 
of impostors using genuine documents. This is 
widely believed to be in response to modern 
sophisticated documents being more difficult 
to falsify or reproduce. In 2013 document ex-
perts and border guards raised concerns that 
more authentic documents were also being 
fraudulently obtained as another alternative 
to producing expensive falsifications.
Because more countries participated in the 
EDF-RAN in 2013, the total number of detec-
tions of authentic documents would also be 
expected to increase, even in the absence of 
any change in relative detections of different 
modi operandi. To assess the degree to which 
authentic documents are becoming more 
commonly used as a modus operandi, it is nec-
essary to look at the proportion of overall 
detections of document fraud that involved 
authentic documents. Analyses were repeated 
excluding countries that joined the EDF-RAN 
in 2013, with no difference to the results.
EDF-RAN data confirm that authentic pass-
ports were detected proportionally more 
frequently in 2013 than in previous years 
(Fig. 11), suggesting that abuse of authentic 
documents is an increasing modus operandi to 
illegally enter the EU / Schengen area. For ex-
ample, in 2012 impostors and fraudulently ob-

tained documents represented 23% and 4% of 
overall passport fraud, respectively, whereas 
in 2013 these proportions increased to 28% 
and 6%, indicating that this type of abuse is 
becoming more common at the expense of 
other modi operandi.
Trends
Back in 2012 the most commonly detected 
type of document fraud was the use of coun-
terfeit border-crossing stamps to fabricate 
travel histories and extend periods of stay in 
the Schengen area. This type of fraud was as-
sociated with Ukrainian nationals detected at 
their land border with Poland and Ukraine and 
was indicative of circular migration patterns. 
However, the majority of migrants abusing 
border-crossing stamps in 2012 were from Al-
bania most frequently detected at their land 
border with Greece. Albanians were not only 
detected here but were also very frequently 
detected attempting to enter the UK from the 
Schengen area, often using counterfeit Italian 
ID cards. The combination of these two phe-
nomena rendered Albanians the nationality 
most associated with document fraud in 2012.
In 2013, detections of Albanians fell by half but 
they were still ranked second at the EU level. 
Albanians were mostly detected at the Greek 
and, to a lesser extent, the Croatian land bor-
der but also at the Spanish air border. Coun-
terfeit Greek border-crossing stamps were 
still the most commonly detected fraudulent 
document at the EU level in 2013.
In 2013, following a threefold increase com-
pared to the year before, Syrian irregular 
migrants were by far the most commonly 
detected document fraudsters in the EU. 
They were most commonly detected at the 
German, Italian, Portuguese and Austrian 
air borders, as well as at Kapitan Andreevo, 
a Bulgarian land BCP with Turkey. Some EU 
airports tend to distrust claimed nationali-
ties and so report very large volumes of de-
tections of unknown nationalities. However, 
a comparative analysis suggests that many 
of these unknown nationalities are actu-
ally Syrians, which would mean that the fig-
ures presented here are an underestimation 
of the actual numbers of Syrians arriving 
in the EU / Schengen area with fraudulent 
documents.
Another key hotspot for detections of doc-
ument fraud of a single nationality was visi-
ble in detections of Moroccans at the Spanish 
sea border. In this case detections were ex-
clusively reported from the Spanish cities of 
Ceuta and Melilla, where Moroccans were 
detected using a broad suite of authentic 
documents as impostors. These document 
included Spanish ID cards and residence per-
mits, and Moroccan passports presumably 
with valid visas contained within.
3.2.4. Illegal border-crossing
Detections of illegal border-crossing along the 
EUs external borders sharply increased be-
tween 2012 and 2013, from 72 437 to 107 365, 
which represented an annual increase of 48%. 
Although significant, the 2013 level is compa-
rable to the totals reported by Member States 
in 2009 and 2010 (104 599 and 104 060, re-
spectively) and is still lower than the total re-
ported during the Arab Spring in 2011 (141 051). 
Apart from this rising trend, the year 2013 
was characterised by three phenomena: a 
large increase in illegal border-crossings by 
Syrians (subsequently applying for asylum) 
on the Eastern Mediterranean route and in 
the Central Mediterranean; a steady flow of 
migrants departing from North Africa (Libya 
and Egypt) putting their life at risk to cross 
the Mediterranean Sea; and a sharp increase, 
mostly in January-June, in detections reported 
on the Western Balkan route.
In 2013, there was also a sharp contrast 
between the beginning of the year, which 
started with the lowest quarterly total re-
29 of 80
corded since 2009 (9 717 in Q1 2013), and 
the third quarter, which reported one of the 
highest quarterly totals (42 789 detections in 
Q3 2013). This swift fluctuation in less than 
six months shows the rapidly evolving situa-
tion at the external border and the difficulty 
in forecasting flows that appear to be driven 
as much by local circumstances as by devel-
opment outside the EU.
In terms of nationalities, Syrians, Eritreans, 
Afghans and Albanians together accounted 
for 52% of total detections (or 55 359). Syrians 
alone (25 546) represented almost a quarter 
of the total. Their detections at the EU bor-
der tripled between 2012 and 2013. Unlike 
in previous years when the top nationality 
tended to be reported from only a few bor-
der areas, suggesting that the flows were 
controlled by a limited number of facilita-
tors, Syrians were reported as the top na-
tionality detected illegally crossing in most 
border areas. They were also the top nation-
ality for other indicators, in particular asylum 
applications, reflecting the dire situation in 
Syria and the desperate plight of Syrian asy-
lum seekers. Border-control authorities, of-
ten the first authorities they encountered, 
received their requests for asylum and re-
ferred them to asylum authorities.
Eritreans ranked second in 2013, with 11 298 
detections, or 11% of the total. This repre-
sented one of the most significant increases 
(fourfold), as their detections in 2012 totalled 
2 604. The vast majority of Eritreans were de-
tected on the Central Mediterranean route 
(9 926, or nearly 90%), after departing from 
Libya. Following a similar route, Somalis were 
also detected in large numbers in 2013 (5 624), 
which level is comparable to 2012 (5 038). Al-
together, detections of Eritreans and Somalis 
totalled 16 922, or 16% of all detections. This 
relatively large share shows the importance 
of the migration flow from the Horn of Af-
rica to the EU, a flow that is often perilous 
as migrants have to cross the Sahara, transit 
through Libya, where they are often ostra-
cised, and then cross the Mediterranean Sea.
Detections of Afghans sharply decreased to 
about 9 500 in 2013, down from 13 169 de-
tections in 2012 and nearly 26 000 in 2010. 
In nearly all indicators, Afghans were at their 
lowest level since 2009, suggesting a pause 
in their movements to the EU in 2013.
The number of detected Albanians was sim-
ilar to that of Afghans, with 9 021 detections, 
mostly reported from the land border be-
tween Greece and Albania. This was an in-
crease of 60% and came after two years of 
relatively low detections, with about 5 000 
detections in 2011 and 2012.
Although they do not appear among the top 
nationalities, detections of Nigerians (3 386), 
Malians (2 887), Senegalese (1 643) and Gam-
bians (2 817) all quadrupled or more compared 
to 2012. Together they totalled 10 733 detec-
tions (10% of all), and were mostly reported 
from the Central Mediterranean.
Routes
In the annual total for 2013, detections of il-
legal border-crossing on the Central Med-
iterranean route accounted for the largest 
percentage of all detections (40 304, or 38% 
of the total). This represented a fourfold in-
crease in detections compared to 2012, but 
the 2013 total remained below the detec-
tions reported in 2011, i.e. the year of the Arab 
Spring. Closely related are also the detections 
in the area of Apulia and Calabria, mostly 
linked to departures from the Eastern Med-
iterranean, totalling nearly 5 000 detections.
Detections on the Eastern Mediterranean 
route continued to drop, from a peak of 
57 025 in 2011 to 37 214 in 2012 and 24 799 in 
2013. Detections were roughly equally dis-
tributed between the Eastern Aegean Sea 
and the land borders with Turkey. Detec-

tions reported from the land border between 
Greece and Turkey remained low through-
out the year. The decrease compared to pre-
vious years followed the strengthening of 
border surveillance on the Greek side, in-
cluding the completion of a fence along the 
12-kilometre land connection with Turkey, 
and deployment of additional staff to pa-
trol the area of the River Evros marking the 
land border between Turkey and Greece. 
Greece also took a series of measures in-
land (i.e. changes in the asylum policy and 
return measures), which resulted in curbing 
illegal immigration.
Detections on the Western Balkan route rose 
sharply to a record level of 19 951 detections. 
In July, the number of detections started to 
fall, but stayed above the level of 2012.
Circular migration between Albania and 
Greece increased markedly between 2012 
and 2013 (8 729, +59%), but the 2013 total 
remains below the number of detections 
in 2009 (40 250) and 2010 (35 297), corre-
sponding to the period before visa liberali-
sation for Albanians.
The situation remained relatively stable in the 
Western Mediterranean (6 838, compared to 
6 397 in 2012) and along the eastern land bor-
der (1 316, compared to 1 597 in 2012).
n	Central Mediterranean route
In the Central Mediterranean area, the large 
and sudden increase in detections in 2011, fol-
lowing the turmoil in Tunisia and Libya, had 
been significantly reduced by the end of 2011, 
but resumed in 2012. In 2013, the number of 
detections was low in the first quarter, but 
gradually increased from the second quarter 
to reach a peak in the third. Out of the an-
nual total of 40 304 detections, 75% were re-
ported in only four months, i.e. between July 
and October 2013, with a peak in September, 
a pattern also observed in 2012.
Tragically, this period of an intense flow of 
migrants between North Africa and the EU 
saw several major incidents of boats capsiz-
ing in the region resulting in a massive loss 
of life, including women and children. These 
events were widely reported in the media 
and attracted a lot of political attention to

the issue of irregular migration in the Medi-
terranean in general, including several state-
ments released by the EU Commissioner for 
Home Affairs.
Since then, detections of migrants have 
dropped considerably from nearly 8 000 
detections in October to 1 297 in November 
2013, but this decrease also coincided with 
the traditional winter low period when rough 
sea conditions render sailing hazardous. A 
closer analysis of the data showed that, com-
pared to previous years, detections in De-
cember 2013 (2 476) were the largest for a 
month of December since 2008, when sys-
tematic data monitoring started. This indi-
cates the determination of migrants stranded 
in Libya, mostly sub-Saharans and Syrians, 
to sail to the EU despite the difficult win-
ter conditions.

Mediterranean routes

An increased use of rubber boats has also 
been reported, mostly by sub-Saharans. Com-
pared to fishing boats, rubber boats put mi-
grants lives at a greater risk, but offer the 
cheapest sailing option. On the other hand, 
when fishing boats or larger boats are used, 
they tend to be overcrowded, which also in-
creases the risk of them capsizing. To prevent 
this, search and rescue operations are under-
taken ever closer to the Libyan coast. How-
ever, the awareness of these measures among 
facilitators and migrants decreases their over-
all perception of risk taken when embarking 
on what remains a perilous journey.
Nationalities
Together, nationals from the Horn of Africa, 
in this case Eritreans (9 926) and Somalis 
(4 497), represented the largest proportion 
of detections on the Central Mediterranean 
route, totalling 14 423, or 36%. During inter-
views conducted in the framework of the JO 
Hermes, most Eritreans and Somalis indicated 
that they had left their countries due to se-
curity and economic and concerns. Somalis 
and Eritreans reported using the same route 
through Ethiopia and Sudan.
Syrian migrants ranked second in the an-
nual total for 2013, with 9 591 detections, 
representing nearly a quarter of the total. 
Many departed from Libyas coastal area 
near Zuwarah, but the largest proportion 
departed from Egypt. They often travelled 
in family units.
Overall, three main flows can be distinguished 
departing from Libya: (1) Syrians, often ar-
riving from Egypt and departing on wooden 
boats from Zuwarah on the western Libyan 
coast, which offers the shortest connection 
to the EUs southern external border; (2) na-
tionals from the Horn of Africa; and (3) na-
tionals from West Africa.
Egyptian migrants were also reported on the 
Central Mediterranean route, with 1 982 de-
tections in 2013.

n	Eastern Mediterranean route
Since data collection began in early 2008, 
the Eastern Mediterranean has maintained 
its status as a hotspot of irregular migration. 
However, following the implementation of a 
set of Greek operations in August 2012 as well 
as the continued implementation of Frontex-
coordinated Joint Operations (Poseidon Sea 
and Land), detections significantly dropped 
at the Greek-Turkish land border. In 2013, the 
figure was the lowest reported on this route 
since 2009, but the route still ranked second 
and accounted for nearly a quarter of all de-
tections for illegal border-crossing to the EU.
Compared to 2011 and 2012, the areas of de-
tections also considerably changed, and de-
tections in the Eastern Aegean Sea were the 
largest, followed by detections along the land 
border between Bulgaria and Turkey.
Syrians represented more than half of all de-
tections on this route (12 727, or 51%) and al-
though they were mostly reported at the 
land border between Bulgaria and Turkey 
and in the Eastern Aegean Sea, they were 
also the single most detected nationality at 
the land border between Greece and Turkey, 
and in Cyprus. Most of them were travelling 
in family groups. Many applied for asylum in 
Bulgaria immediately after their detection, 
as well as in other Member States, but very 
few applied for asylum in Greece.
Afghans ranked second (6  129), mostly de-
tected in the Eastern Aegean Sea, but their 
detections were considerably reduced after 
the peak of 2011 (19 618). Similarly, as compared 
to 2011, detections of illegally staying Afghans 
also decreased, from 25 296 in 2011 to 16 836 
in 2013, as did the number of Afghans apply-
ing for asylum (FRAN data), from 29 672 in 
2011 to 24 060 in 2013. These concurrent de-
creases occur at a time of growing uncertain-
ties for many Afghans living in Afghanistan or 
as refugees in neighbouring Iran and Pakistan.
Detections of Africans has also considera-
bly decreased on the Eastern Mediterranean 
route, from 8 479 in 2012 to 3 460 in 2013.
Bulgarian land border
In this border area, detections considerably 
increased between August 2012 and Octo-
ber 2013, after which they fell sharply. This 
decrease coincided with a strengthening of

surveillance efforts at the land border be-
tween Bulgaria and Turkey and the deploy-
ment of additional staff (police and border 
police officers).
Most migrants crossed the land border with 
the help of local residents from the area of 
Edirne who were either working for the fa-
cilitation networks based in Istanbul or were 
operating independently.
Most detections in this area concerned Syr-
ians. After detections, most Syrians applied 
for asylum. Their number is still small com-
pared with more than 2 million who have 
sought shelter elsewhere according to data 
available at the end of 2013, but has placed 
serious strain on Bulgarian resources. While 
some Syrians opted to stay in Bulgaria, oth-
ers, mostly those with relatives or acquaint-
ances in other Member States, preferred to 
continue mostly to Germany or Sweden.
Greek land border
In 2013, at the land border between Greece 
and Turkey, detections remained very low. 
As at other border sections of the Eastern 
Mediterranean route Syrians ranked first. 
The low number of detections followed the 
strengthening of border surveillance on the 
Greek side in 2012, including the completion 
of a fence along the 12-kilometre land con-
nection with Turkey, and deployment of ad-
ditional staff to patrol the area of the River 
Evros marking the land border between Tur-
key and Greece.
Information reported by the Turkish author-
ities also suggest a continued presence of 
migrants on the Turkish side of the border. 
While most will eventually opt to cross by 
sea or across the neighbouring land border 
to Bulgaria, it is important to highlight that 
the pressure of illegal migration on the Greek-
Turkish land border section remains higher 
than the data on detections for illegal bor-
der-crossing may suggest.
Eastern Aegean Sea
In the Aegean Sea, most of migrants targeted 
the islands of Lesvos and Samos. However, 
detections were reported also elsewhere

area from Samothrace Island in the north 
(reporting its first detections) to Megisti Is-
land in the south.
Nearly 70% of the migrants who had entered 
illegally through the Eastern Aegean Sea were 
detected on the islands after their crossing. 
Detections also occurred in the Ionian Sea 
while migrants were trying to reach Italy.
At the beginning of 2013, most migrants cross-
ing the Eastern Aegean Sea were Afghans, but 
gradually Syrians have become the main na-
tionality reported for illegal border-crossing.
n	Western Balkan route
Detections of illegal border-crossing strongly 
increased on the Western Balkan route, from 
6 391 in 2012 to 19 951 in 2013, reaching a re-
cord high since data collection began in 2008. 
Most of the detections were reported be-
tween January and June 2013 at the land bor-
der between Hungary and Serbia. During that 
period, migrants detected crossing the bor-
der illegally immediately applied for asylum 
and soon absconded to continue their jour-
ney to other Member States. In July, coinciding 
with an amendment in the Hungarian asylum 
policy, the number of detections started to 
decrease, but nevertheless remained higher 
than in previous years.

senting 32% of all detections on this route. 
However, their detections were concentrated 
between April and July 2013 (81% of their 2013 
total), and dropped to a negligible level af-
ter July 2013. This drop followed return flights 
from Hungary to Pristina that were accom-
panied by a media campaign in Kosovo* to 
prevent illegal migration.
Detections of other nationalities, notably 
from Pakistan and Afghanistan, also dropped 
after July 2013, but remained higher than in 
the previous year. African and Asian migrants 
detected at the land border between Hun-
gary and Serbia had originally crossed illegally 
the external border on the Eastern Mediter-
ranean route and then transited through the 
Western Balkans mostly via the border be-
tween Greece and the former Yugoslav Re-
public of Macedonia, and increasingly via the 
Bulgarian-Serbian border.
The accession of Croatia to the EU on 1 July 
2013 did not affect the movements of mi-
grants across the Western Balkans. The bor-
der section between Hungary and Serbia 
remained the main border section for most 
migrants to attempt illegal entry to the EU. 
In addition, this border section also recorded 
a large increase in the traffic flow after 2011, 
in the wake of the visa liberalisation process, 
resulting in a surge in refusals of entry. Bor-
der-control authorities, at a time of budget-
ary constraints, have thus had to face new 
challenges simultaneously on the green bor-
der and at BCPs.
n	 Circular route between Albania and 
Greece
In 2013, Greece reported 8 728 detections of 
illegal border-crossing at its land border with 
Albania and with the former Yugoslav Repub-
lic of Macedonia, of which 8 592 were associ-
ated with Albanians. This represented a 59% 
rise in relation to a year previously.
This substantial increase broke the stable 
situation in place since 2011, when visa lib-
eralisation was granted to Albanians. Prior 
to visa liberalisation, detections had ranged 
between 38 000 and 30 000 a year. How-
ever, since 2011, annual detections of illegal 
border-crossing have been around 5 000.

The introduction of visa liberalisation went 
together with a small increase in refusals of 
entry as more Albanians crossed the bor-
der at BCPs.
n	Western Mediterranean route
In 2013 there were 6 838 detections of illegal 
border-crossing in the Western Mediterra-
nean region, which consists of several areas of 
the southern Spanish coast and the land bor-
ders of Ceuta and Melilla. This total is com-
parable to the total of 6 397 reported in 2012.
In 2013, nearly two-thirds of the detections 
were reported at the land border in Ceuta and 
Melilla. This is probably associated with more 
effective prevention of departures at sea by 
the Moroccan authorities and enhanced pre-
vention measures in the Mediterranean Sea, 
including the EPN JO Indalo. This assumption 
is supported by the fact that the improvement 
of weather conditions in the summer did not 
result in a significant increase in detections 
at the sea border in this region.
Several times in 2013, the Spanish authorities 
warned of the permanent threat of migration 
to Melilla. Indeed, there were several violent 
incidents of migrants attempting to cross the 
fence in large groups (more than a hundred 
persons), sometimes resulting in casualties. 
Once in Melilla, migrants are turned over to 
Spanish Police Headquarters for identifica-
tion, and many are transferred to the Tem-
porary Centre for Immigrants (CETI  Centro 
de Estancia Temporal de Inmigrantes). How-
ever this centre only has a limited capacity 
and some migrants had to be transferred to 
mainland Spain.
The analysis of nationality is problematic as 
most of the detections reported by Spain are 
of unknown nationalities; however, most are 
assumed to be sub-Saharans. There is a re-
luctance of the vast majority of migrants to 
cooperate with the authorities.
n	Apulia and Calabria
In Apulia and Calabria in southern Italy, de-
tections tend to be associated with different 
movements of irregular migration. Most of 
the detections in the area of Apulia are linked 
to secondary movements from Greece to It-
aly, while most of the detections in Calabria 
are associated with migrants who departed 
from Turkey or Egypt and sailed across the 
Aegean Sea towards Italy.
In 2013, detections were stable with a total 
of 4 994 compared to 4 772 in 2012. As in pre-
vious years, most migrants were nationals 
from Asian and Middle East countries. Syri-
ans, ranking first, represented 38% of all the 
detections on this route.
Syrian migrants, acting on family advice, tend 
to refuse to be fingerprinted and travel to 
Catania and Syracuse, where a large number 
of Syrians have successfully landed over the 
past few months. Many continue their jour-
ney to Sweden or Germany where the new 
migrants apply for asylum.
As on the Central Mediterranean area, detec-
tions started to increase in spring and peaked 
in November 2013. The sharpest increases 
were of Syrians and Eritreans, together with 
large numbers of arriving Egyptians. Most 
of these migrants are thought to have de-
parted from North Africa, specifically Egypt. 
In contrast to these increasing trends, the 
number of Pakistanis and Afghans, declined 
compared to 2012.
Detections in Calabria were mostly associ-
ated with departures from Turkey and Egypt, 
and the main nationality detected there were 
Syrians. Many migrants reported tranship-
ment in high seas from large fishing boats 
to smaller wooden boats to reach the shores 
(mother boat modus operandi).

n	Black Sea route
Detections of illegal border-crossing on the 
Black Sea are extremely rare, but in 2013 Bul-
garia reported one attempt of clandestine 
entry at Varna seaport in June and Romania 
reported four incidents involving the detec-
tion of 118 migrants often aided by Turkish 
facilitators attempting to reach the Roma-
nian coast. The migrants were mostly Syri-
ans or Afghans.
These incidents still constitute isolated cases, 
and are possibly linked to the increased sur-
veillance on the Eastern Mediterranean route 
and the increasing number of migrants wait-
ing in Turkey to reach the EU illegally. How-
ever, while these four cases should be taken 
extremely seriously, they are not yet a signal 
of larger shifts towards Romania.
n	Eastern land border route
The eastern land border route is, in effect, 
an amalgam of detections of illegal border-
crossing reported by Finland, Estonia, Latvia, 
Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Ro-
mania. Despite the total length of all the bor-
der sections, detections on this route tend to 
be lower than on other routes, possibly due 
to the long distances from many countries 
of origin. Also, according to several reports 
shared during 2013, visa fraud and counter-
feit border-crossing stamps tend to predom-
inate on this route, as opposed to detections 
of illegal border-crossing.
Detections of illegal border-crossing re-
mained stable between 2012 and 2013, with 
1 316 detections (compared to 1 597 in 2012). 
Similarly to previous years, most of the de-
tections were reported from the land bor-
der between Slovakia and Ukraine. Estonia 
reported an increase, but a large proportion 
of these detections were connected with 
the smuggling of goods rather then irregu-
lar migration.
In terms of nationalities, Georgians ranked 
first, mostly detected at the land border be-
tween Lithuania and Belarus, followed by Af-
ghans, mostly detected at the land border 
between Slovakia and Ukraine.
Detections of illegal border-crossing are also 
kept at low levels along the eastern land 
border thanks to the surveillance efforts of 
neighbouring third countries, in particular 
the Russian Federation and Belarus. Most 
part of the border with Belarus is fenced on 
the Belarusian side. In 2013, a new fence has 
been constructed on the green border be-
tween Norway and the Russian Federation. 
This fence will enable the Russian authori-
ties to re-deploy human resources to other 
parts of the Russian border.
While the threat of illegal border-crossing 
between BCPs along the eastern land border 
seems to be lower than at other sections of 
the external land border of the EU, this bor-
der section is faced with increasing passen-
ger and lorry traffic, which requires additional 
efforts from border-control authorities.
Also, the issue of migrants refused entry and 
then applying for asylum and absconding 
from reception centres is the most serious 
along the eastern land borders. In 2013, it is 
estimated, based on data for refusals of entry 
to Poland and asylum applications in Poland 
and Germany, that about 15 000 Russians of 
Chechen origin used this modus operandi and 
subsequently stayed illegally in the EU. For 
comparison, this is twice the number of de-
tections of illegal border-crossing reported on 
the Western Mediterranean route (6 838), half 
of those reported on the Eastern Mediterra-
nean route (24 799), or 4% of all detections 
of persons staying illegally in the EU in 2013. 
The use of this modus operandi at the eastern 
border appears to be a significant entry chan-
nel of illegal migration to the EU. It exploits 
legal loopholes while still absorbing an im-
portant part of the resources at the border.

3.2.5. Clandestine entries
Detections of clandestine entry in vehicles 
should be analysed in connection with the 
type and number of vehicles crossing through 
BCPs. However, as for passenger flow, data on 
regular traffic of vehicles are rather limited. 
Car traffic is particularly significant in Slove-
nia, while Romania and Hungary both man-
age large numbers of lorries at their borders. 
This is important, as lorry traffic is known to 
have a disproportionately negative effect on 
crossing times.
It is difficult to analyse this indicator because 
some Member States do not report any de-
tections. Thus, the low number points to dif-
ficulties in reporting rather than to the low 
use of this modus operandi along the exter-
nal EU borders.
Detections of illegal border-crossing at (rather 
than between) BCPs are restricted to the ex-
ternal land and sea borders of the EU and to 
detections that are confirmed clandestine 
entries (e.g. hiding in means of transport). 
Their volume is extremely low for the whole 
of the EU, with 599 detections in 2013, espe-
cially compared with other indicators, such 
as detections of illegal border-crossing be-
tween BCPs (107 360).
Clandestine entry requires migrants to stay 
in confinement for long periods of time, and 
is known to put migrants lives at risk of suf-
focation and dehydration. Therefore, most 
of the migrants detected hiding in vehicles 
at BCPs are single young males, rather than 
more vulnerable family groups.
According to information provided by West-
ern Balkan countries and several EU Member 
States, there is considerable variation in the 
modus operandi considering the points of de-
parture (either straight from Greece or in sev-
eral legs through the Western Balkans) and 
types of vehicles used (cars, buses, cargo / pas-
senger trains). In some reported cases irregu-
lar migrants were hidden in railway carriages 
of international trains departing from Greece.
In view of the very low number of detections 
reported at the external borders compared to 
the large volume of vehicle (particularly lorry) 
crossings, it is reasonable to assume that de-
tections underestimate the actual number of 
clandestine entries. While checking all vehi-
cles would introduce undue waiting time for 
many bona fide travellers, targeted checks 
on some vehicles meeting specific risk crite-
ria would make it possible to determine with 
more precision the extent of the phenome-
non and better prevent it. Operational risk 
analysis techniques, similar to those used by 
customs or for checking lorries at the border 
between Schengen Member States and the 
UK, could be adapted to the specificities of 
the external borders.
Figure 20. The low number of detections probably underestimates the actual scale of 
clandestine entry of migrants hiding in lorries or private cars

3.2.3. Cross-border crime
Frontex promotes and coordinates European 
border management with a special focus on 
migration flows. In application of the concept 
of Integrated Border Management, it addi-
tionally supports Member States in combat-
ing organised crime at the external borders, 
including the smuggling of goods and traf-
ficking in human beings.
However, due to the legal and institutional 
national characteristics, border guard author-
ities along the external borders of the EU have 
different types and degrees of responsibili-
ties in the fight against transnational crimes. 
The nature and extent of inter-agency co-
operation at the external borders thus dif-
fers greatly between EU Member States. 
Regarding the prevention of smuggling of 
illicit goods, border-control authorities of 
one Member State play only an assisting 
role, while border-control authorities in an-
other Member State share their tasks with 
Customs or are able conduct their own in-
vestigations. Because of these differences, 
cross-border crime data reported by some 
national border guard institutions are par-
tial and sometimes do not include data col-
lected by customs.
On the other hand, identifying cross-bor-
der movements of persons involved in crim-
inal activities or victims thereof is a crucial 
task of border-control authorities. Either in 
the case of human trafficking or the travel 
of voluntary fighters with a jihadist back-
ground, border agencies are confronted with 
new challenges particularly in the field of 
international and inter-agency coopera-
tion, profiling, identification, and assistance 
to victims.
Smuggling of illicit drugs
Cannabis from North Africa and the Western 
Balkans
The EU is destination for several main routes 
for various narcotic drugs, coming from dif-
ferent regions of the world. According to the 
EMCDDA/Europol EU Drug Markets Report*, 
cannabis resin had been the most seized drug 
in Europe for many years. The main provider 
of cannabis resin to Europe is Morocco, al-
though its production capacities are in decline 
while those in Afghanistan are re-emerg-
ing. Amounts seized in Spain, the country 
reporting the largest detections, exceeded 
the domestic demand by around 15%. Large 
amounts of cannabis resin are then forwarded 
to the Netherlands and particularly Belgium.
In 2010, seizures of herbal cannabis exceeded 
resin seizures for the first time in Europe. The 
shift towards herbal cannabis was predom-
inantly caused by an increase of domestic 
production in many European countries. This 
means that trafficking across the EU exter-
nal borders has decreased, with the domes-
tic production increasingly satisfying national 
demand. An exception seems to be traffick-
ing activities in southeast Europe, where 
mainly Albanian cannabis supplies customer 
demands of countries including Greece, Italy, 
Slovenia, and Hungary.
By August 2013, the Italian Guardia di Finanza 
concluded a major aerial surveillance oper-
ation to determine the amount of cannabis 
which is produced by Albanian criminals. Af-
ter an examination of 12.5% of the Albanian 
territory, experts could identify the existence 
of 500 plantations, which according to Italian 
estimates produce an annual 1 000 tonnes of 
herbal cannabis worth around EUR 4.5 bil-
lion. More than 300 hectares were identified 
around the Albanian town of Lazarat near 
the Greek border, which is essentially under 
control of the local producers.

Cocaine from South America
According to EMCDDA/Europol calculations 
based on seizure data*, cocaine shows to be 
the third most intensively smuggled drug in 
Europe after cannabis resin and herb. The sei-
zure numbers increased between the mid-
nineties and 2007, but have been declining 
since 2009.
Between 2001 and 2011, Spain accounted for 
around 50% of all cocaine seizures in the EU. 
Large shipments travelled by sea from Argen-
tina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, 
Peru and Venezuela to Spain and Portugal. 
A large share of the substance arrived from 
South America via the African route. Since 
2004, countries like Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, 
the Gambia and Senegal have been develop-
ing into a region for transit and redistribu-
tion**, with absolute turnovers by the criminal 
organisations often exceeding national secu-
rity budgets of West African countries.
Drug traffickers preferred to transport the co-
caine by aircraft, speedboats, maritime ves-
sels and with couriers on commercial flights 
to the EU, and tried to avoid the exposure of 
risky overland transfers. Nevertheless, ac-
cording to UNODC and various other public 
sources, South American cocaine is going to 
be increasingly transported across the Sahara 
and North Africa to Europe, thereby affecting 
stability in countries such as Mali and Libya.***
A diversification of trafficking routes away 
from the very dominant routes to the Iberian 
Peninsula drew a larger share of cocaine to 
the ports of the Balkans and the Black Sea. 
Between 2009 and 2011, four tonnes of co-
caine have been seized in Bulgaria, Greece, 
Romania and Turkey, accounting for 2% of 
the overall number of seizures reported in 
Europe.**** Although appearing comparably 
low, the share of these four countries has 
grown threefold since 2001. Moreover, the

Heroin from Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan
Seizure and treatment numbers suggest that 
heroin use in Europe has been decreasing dur-
ing the last decade, while consumers often 
replaced the substance with other, mostly 
synthetic drugs. However, seizures show that 
heroin is still smuggled along the traditional 
routes to the EU and remains a considera-
ble source of income for internationally op-
erating Organised Crime Groups. Most of the 
heroin consumed in the EU is produced in Af-
ghanistan and, to a lesser extent, in Iran and 
Pakistan. It is transported along two major 
routes to Europe: the Balkan route, which 
runs through Turkey and the Balkan coun-
tries, and the Northern or Silk route, which 
heads through Central Asia and the Russian 
Federation.
As regards the heroin smuggled along the 
Balkan route, Turkey plays a central role due 
to its multiple trade and road connections to

operation identified over 500 cannabis plantations in the Albanian

Asia and Europe. Between 2001 and 2009, 
seizures in Turkey increased three to fourfold 
to 16 tonnes annually, contrasting the steady 
decline that was registered in the rest of Eu-
rope, where only half of this amount could 
be seized in 2009. In the years 2010 and 2011, 
however, numbers of incidents and quanti-
ties of heroin seized appeared to be in steady 
decline, both in the EU and Turkey.
From Turkey, smuggled heroin usually enters 
the EU through the land borders of Greece 
and Bulgaria. In a particularly significant in-
cident on 1 August 2013, Turkish border au-
thorities detected 717 kg of heroin at the 
BCP Hamzabeyli on a Croatian-registered 
lorry driven by a Croatian citizen. The offic-
ers found the 1 400 packages of heroin worth 
around EUR 13.5 million between dishwashers, 
washing machines, and LCD TVs. The lorry 
that was loaded in Istanbul was on the way 
to Bosnia and Herzegovina for a layover be-
fore further continuing its journey to the EU. 
Similar but smaller seizures were also made in 
Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Kosovo* and Serbia.
New psychoactive substances from China and 
India
New psychoactive substances comprise a 
wide range of drugs that are not yet under 
control of national or international drug leg-
islation. In 2012, the Early Warning System of 
the EMCDDA and Europol listed a total of 73 
synthetic substances. Although new psycho-
active substances represent only a small share 
of the illicit drugs market, they are particularly 
dangerous because limited information about 
their effects on the human body is available. 
These substances often come in the form of 
more openly sold Legal Highs, thereby giving 
the false impression of legality and lower con-
sumer exposure to physical and mental health 
risks. They are believed to be largely used by 
producers as replacements for more tradi-
tional drugs in short supply, as has been the 
case with MDMA, better known as Ecstasy.
* This designation is 
without prejudice to 
positions on status, and is 
in line with UNSCR 1244 
and the ICJ Opinion on 
the Kosovo declaration of 
independence.
The challenges for law-enforcement author-
ities at air and other external borders of the 
EU lie within the development of widely es-
tablished capacities to identify a diversity of 
quickly emerging trends. Drug control leg-
islative measures within the EU also need a 
more coherent approach to prevent the ex-
ploitation of differences and gaps between 
national jurisdictions.
Trafficking in human beings (THB)
The detection of persons trafficked for sex-
ual exploitation, forced labour or other pur-
poses represents a major challenge for border 
authorities, as victims themselves are often 
not aware about their fate when they arrive 
in the transit or destination countries. Bor-
der agencies in the EU and in third coun-
tries developed measures in various fields 
to achieve better results in the detection of 
incoming victims:
n  At air borders, some EU authorities wid-
ened the time window for identification 
of potential cases of THB by monitoring 
areas between the boarding gate and the 
airport arrival area. Moreover, flight crews 
were trained to identify potential victims 
and traffickers already in the plane.
n  Some authorities took stronger meas-
ures to investigate the circumstances of 
the travel of unaccompanied children.
n  Measures were improved to identify fraud-
ulent travel and supporting documents.
n  An example from a third country is the 
development of a proactive screen-
ing programme at Taiwanese airports, 
which encourages immigrant workers to 
complete an online questionnaire on the 
circumstances of their employment. Im-
mediate assistance is offered when cer-
tain indicators become visible.
As of February 2014, 20 countries have no-
tified of a full transposition of the Directive 
2011 / 36 / EU of the European Parliament and 
of the Council of 5 April 2011 on preventing 
Frontex · annual risk analysis 2014
44 of 80
and combating trafficking in human beings 
and protecting its victims. The Directive de-
fines the minimum common rules for identi-
fying and sanctioning offences of trafficking 
in human beings.
In 2013, Eurostat presented its first report 
and statistics on THB at the EU level, includ-
ing data on the years 2008 to 2010. Within 
three years, the number of identified victims, 
male and female, registered by police, NGOs 
and other agencies in the EU Member States 
increased from 3 691 (2008) to 4 198 (2009) 
and 5 535 (2010).* As Eurostat points out, more 
reported cases are not necessarily related to 
a higher number of actual victims. The up-
ward tendency may also be caused by an im-
proved reporting rate of the phenomenon.
Data disaggregated by types of exploitation 
during the three reference years show that 
a majority of 62% of the victims were traf-
ficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation 
and 25% for labour exploitation. Others were 
trafficked for forced begging, criminal activ-
ities, removal of organs and other purposes. 
Important for border guards at the external 
borders is the fact that the share of victims 
from non-EU countries increased from 12% to 
37% for male and from 18% to 39% for female 
victims between 2008 and 2010.
According to Eurostat, the main third coun-
tries of origin in 2010 were Nigeria, China, 
Paraguay, the Dominican Republic, Colom-
bia, the Russian Federation, Brazil, Vietnam, 
Namibia and Algeria. Two patterns are vis-
ible within the three reference years. First, 
the number of victims from Latin Amer-
ica increased strongly while the number 
of victims from the EUs immediate neigh-
bourhood decreased. This shift indicates an 
increased use of air borders as entry gates for 
trafficking to the EU. Second, victims from 
Nigeria and China are consistently strongly 
represented throughout the reference pe-
riod and beyond, thus adding to the nec-

European foreign fighters in Syria
According to law-enforcement authorities 
and experts, the number of Europeans with a 
jihadist agenda fighting in the conflict in Syria 
has significantly increased during 2013. Ac-
cording to an estimate made by the Interna-
tional Centre for the Study of Radicalisation 
in December**, between 396 and 1 937 fight-
ers from Western Europe are presently tak-
ing part in the Syrian armed conflict. Since 
the previous estimate of April 2013, the num-
bers, which are based on Member State esti-
mates and open sources, have risen threefold. 
Official figures from France and Denmark on 
that phenomenon have tripled and author-
ities in Belgium, Germany and the UK have 
even quadrupled their numbers. In January 
2014, the French government stated that 
around a dozen of the French nationals in 
Syria or willing to go there are minors, be-
ing as young as 15 years of age.
In light of this development, national govern-
ments and EU representatives are increas-
ingly discussing ways to monitor and prevent 
the movements of young people to Syria. Ter-
rorism experts and law-enforcement officials 
fear that some of these fighters may return 
to Europe ideologically and militarily trained, 
thus posing a terrorist threat to societies.
Smuggling of weapons
In a scheme revealed in December 2013, 
French police has disrupted a particularly 
large smuggling ring that trafficked several 
hundreds of guns, pistols, Kalashnikovs, am-
munition and spare parts mainly from the 
Western Balkans to France.
According to media reports published in No-
vember 2013, the Hellenic Coast Guard inter-
cepted a cargo ship near the Aegean island

The North Africa and Middle East represent-
ative for the United Nations Office for Drugs 
and Crime recently warned that the insta-
bility and armed conflict in the Middle East 
led to massive arms smuggling in the region.
Exit of stolen motor vehicles
According to Eurostat, the total number of 
vehicles including cars, motorcycles, buses, 
lorries, construction and agricultural vehi-
cles stolen in the EU has been steadily fall-
ing from 1.85 million in 1998 to 0.88 million in 
2010. Among the reasons were the advanced 
technical protection measures developed by 
the producers and intensified international 
law-enforcement cooperation.
Only a small share of the vehicles stolen in 
the EU is detected at its external borders, 
often in the context of Frontex Joint Opera-
tions. In contrast to the overall theft statis-
tics, detections at the borders reported to 
Frontex showed a slight increase from 498 
in 2012 to 519 in 2013. The increase may have 
been caused by increased awareness and 
relevant expertise of Frontex Guest Officers 
and regular border guards.
Most car thefts were detected by querying 
SIS II, the Interpol and national theft data 
with the Vehicle Identification Numbers (VIN) 
specified on the engine, frame and major 
parts of most motor vehicles. Car thieves 
applied various modi operandi to cloud the 
identity of their stolen vehicles at the exter-
nal borders. Reports indicated frequent ma-
nipulation of the VIN, or departure from the 
EU with rental or very recently stolen cars 
before authorities are notified of the theft. 
In other cases, vehicles were disassembled 
into parts to obscure identification or pow-
ers of attorney containing an authorisation 
to travel abroad were counterfeited.
Modi operandi as mentioned above were reg-
ularly reported at the EU eastern borders, 
where detections of stolen motor vehicles 
on exit increased from 289 in 2012 to 313 in 
2013. The vehicle brand preferences did not 
change during the last years, as almost 40% 
of the cars detected were produced by Volk-
swagen, Mercedes Benz and BMW. A majority 
of the persons driving the stolen vehicles had 
the nationality of the country to which they 
intended to leave the EU. For example, 131 of 
the 192 persons attempting to transfer their 
stolen vehicle to Ukraine were of Ukrainian 
nationality, only 35 were EU citizens.
Smuggling of excise goods
Tobacco
According to estimates of the European Anti-
Fraud Office (OLAF), the smuggling and do-
mestic illicit production of cigarettes caused 
an annual financial damage of over EUR 10 
billion in the budgets of the EU and its Mem-
ber States. In effect of the financial and euro 
crisis of the last years, many governments in-
creased the taxes on excise goods to reduce 
their budget deficits. Between July 2012 and 
2013, at least ten EU Member States increased 
their duties on cigarettes, in average by EUR 
0.33 per pack of the Most popular price cate-
gory, as defined by the European Commission.*
Currently, a customer would pay for an av-
erage pack of cigarettes EUR 5 in Finland, 
whereas across the Russian border, the same

Not only individual consumers and small scale 
smugglers from economically weak border 
regions try to make use of existing price dif-
ferences. Large scale criminal businesses il-
licitly import cigarettes from as far away as 
Asia to Western European markets.
In June 2013, the European Commission pre-
sented a new strategy to step up fight against 
illicit tobacco trade, which stipulates the in-

volvement of producers and countries of ori-
gin and the improvement of international and 
inter-agency cooperation. It moreover pro-
vides strengthened sanctions and harmo-
nised definitions of customs infringements.
In order to address the problem of contra-
band cigarettes and to prevent the over-
supply of third-country markets, the EU has 
already signed legally binding agreements 
with the four largest tobacco manufactur-
ers, which cover 80% of the world market. 
Through these agreements the companies 
committed themselves to sell to legitimate 
clients only and to implement a tracking sys-
tem that assists law-enforcement authori-
ties in determining if cigarettes are traded 
illegally. The smuggling of the main brands 
produced by these four large companies has 
decreased substantially over the past years.

However, smaller companies outside the EU 
still sell large quantities to third-country mar-
kets where only an insignificant share of these 
cigarettes can be absorbed by the local de-
mand. Much of the rest is then smuggled 
out to EU countries. In particular seizures 
of cheap white brands have been show-
ing a strong upward tendency over the past 
years. An example is the Jin Ling cigarette 
brand produced in Kaliningrad, which grew 
so popular among western consumers that 
this brand itself became being counterfeited.
Although cigarette prices were recently also 
increased in the eastern neighbourhood of 
the EU, the smuggling of cigarettes from 
Belarus, Moldova, the Russian Federation, 
and Ukraine remained highly profitable and 
fuelled the growth of transnational organised 
crime groups active in that business.
Petroleum products
The contraband of fuel was mainly reported 
at the eastern European borders with Bela-
rus, the Russian Federation, Ukraine, and the 
Western Balkan countries. This illegal activity 
was caused by the price difference between 
EU Member States and their third-country 
neighbours. In many cases, the smugglers 
crossed the border several times a week to 
fill up the large or illegally extended pet-
rol tanks of their private vehicles. This kind 
of ant smuggling did not only cause fiscal 
losses, but also increased the workload of 
border guards significantly. Large shares of 
the border queues at the eastern European 
borders were regularly caused by fuel smug-
glers. Member States such as Estonia, Poland 
and Slovakia are currently taking measures to 
prevent individuals from crossing the borders 
on a regular basis to import fuel for other than 
private use. Travellers arriving in Estonia by 
motor vehicle, for example, may now bring 
fuel exempt from excise duty in the quantity 
of one regular fuel tank only at the first en-
try within a calendar month.
3.3. After the border
3.3.1. Asylum applications
Analysing trends in asylum applications is 
important for border-control authorities 
because they are often the first authorities 
prospective applicants meet, before being 
referred to asylum authorities. For border-
control authorities, they thus represent an 
important workload. Border-control author-
ities also play a role in the implementation of 
the Dublin system. As mentioned in recital 3 
of the Eurodac Regulation (and in recital 4 of 
the recast Eurodac Regulation), for the pur-
poses of applying the Dublin Regulation, it is 
necessary to establish the identity of appli-
cants for asylum and of persons apprehended 
in connection with the unlawful crossing of 
the external borders. Finally, unfounded ap-
plications for international protection inevi-
tably delay the examination and subsequent 
provision of protection for those third-coun-
try nationals with genuine claims. When ap-
plications are made further to an attempt to 
illegally enter the territory (illegal border-
crossing, document fraud, refusal of entry, 
clandestine entry), it overloads border-control 
authorities and dilutes allocated resources.
In line with EU Regulation (EC) 862 / 2007, 
complete data on asylum applications for 
2013 are due at the end of February 2014 and 
are usually available from Eurostat at the be-
ginning of March 2014. The following analysis 
is based on FRAN data, which are prelimi-
nary data made available by border-control 
authorities and for France and the Nether-
lands only they include applications made at 
the border.
The number of asylum claims submitted to 
the FRAN increased very significantly. In 2013 
the number of applications rose to a record 
high since the FRAN was established in 2008, 
at 353 991 applications following the previ-
ous record year of 2012 (276 308 applications).
Frontex · annual risk analysis 2014
48 of 80
The main countries of citizenship were Syria, 
the Russian Federation and Afghanistan, 
while applications from citizens of Western 
Balkan countries continued to be significant 
despite being overwhelmingly judged to be 
unfounded by Member States.
Syrians were by far the most common na-
tionality to request international protection 
with 50 096 applications. This is nearly twice 
as much as the already very high number of 
applications submitted by Syrians in 2012 and 
represented a significant increase in numbers 
for the EU, but remained a tiny proportion of 
the overall number of asylum seekers which, 
according to UNHCR surpassed 2.3 million to-
date (February 2014). In the EU, more than two-
thirds of all Syrian applications were submitted 
in Sweden (16 125), Germany (12 402) and Bul-
garia (4 511). By contrast, very few applied for 
asylum were submitted in Greece which, like 
Bulgaria, neighbours Turkey from where many 
Syrians arrived in the EU. Indeed, although 
Greece allows Syrians to stay in the country for 
six months, many do not consider applying for 
asylum there because they receive little support 
and prefer to apply in other Member States.
While many Syrians crossed illegally the ex-
ternal border before applying for asylum, the 
total number of asylum applications of Syri-
ans was twice as high as the number of de-
tections of illegal border-crossing (25 546). 
This difference may be linked to a combina-
tion of factors, including possibly significant 
numbers of Syrians who:
n  crossed the border illegally and have not 
been detected;
n  had been already legally or illegally stay-
ing in the EU and who claimed asylum as 
it became clear that the prospect of re-
turn to Syria was impossible;
n  entered the EU with valid travel docu-
ments and applied for asylum (e.g. peo-
ple who obtained a visa for the purpose 
of family reunification and applied for asy-
lum once in the country).
A few Member States also allowed entry and 
residence to Syrians through other channels. 
On the basis of a temporary humanitarian ad-
mission programme (temporäres humanitäres 
Aufnahmeprogramm) of 30 May 2013, Germany 
selected, jointly with UNHCR, about 5 000 
Syrian refugees in Lebanon. The extension of 
this programme of 23 December 2013 includes 
further 5 000 Syrians from Syria, the neigh-
bouring countries (Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and 
Turkey) and Egypt. Persons qualified for the 
programme receive a preliminary residence 
permit for two years. They are supposed to 
travel on their own and are then distributed 
among German federal states. Those with a 
criminal record in Germany or any connec-
tions to criminal or terrorist organisations 
are excluded from this programme.
In the first half of 2013, Hungary reported a 
large increase in asylum applications, from 
1 854 in the second semester of 2012 to 12 185 
in the first semester of 2013, one of the most 
spectacular increases recorded in the FRAN. 
This increase was due to the January 2013 
change in legislation in the Hungary asylum 
policy to bring it in line with EU standards. The 
news of this change quickly spread among 
migrants from Kosovo* (many of whom are 
able to transit Serbia easily, having pass-
ports or other official documentation) creat-
ing a pull factor that resulted in an increase

without prejudice to 
positions on status, and is

and the ICJ Opinion on

independence.
Legitimacy of asylum claims
There is no legal definition of a  legitimate or illegitimate 
claim at this stage. However, the recast Asylum Procedures 
Directive includes the concepts of inadmissible / admissible-
unfounded / admissible-manifestly unfounded applications, 
which may be the basis for a future classification. Until Mem-
ber States transpose the recast Asylum Procedures Directive 
into their national legislation and an appropriate report-
ing is put in place, it will be difficult to address the ques-
tion of international protection claim legitimacy.

bia, followed by concurrent asylum applica-
tions. Hungary quickly reacted with media 
campaigns and returns organised to  Kosovo*, 
the main origin of asylum applicants, as well 
as further change in the asylum policy.
Much of the increase between 2012 and 2013 
was also due to more asylum applications 
submitted by citizens of the Russian Feder-
ation of Chechen origin in Poland and then 
again in Germany. Most of these applications 
are most likely of the same individuals who 
first applied in Poland and then in Germany.
In Bulgaria, the number of asylum applica-
tions also rose sharply, although from a low 
base. Bulgaria reported 7 144 asylum appli-
cations in 2013 which is a massive increase 
compared to a year previously (1 376). The in-
crease was mostly due to Syrians whose ap-
plications accounted for nearly two-thirds of 
all applications in Bulgaria for the year. Syr-
ians mostly travelled in family units. There 
is some evidence that many had already re-
ceived protection in Turkey, but Bulgaria 
offers comparatively cheaper living condi-
tions while being relatively close to Syria. 
The Bulgarian reception system was quickly 
overloaded and Bulgaria is still opening new 
centres and trying to improve conditions in 
the reception centres.
Syrians who had crossed the border illegally 
to Italy and Greece instead did not generally 
apply for asylum there but continued on to 
other EU Member States.
Western Balkan nationals, mostly from Serbia, 
continued to apply in large number for asy-
lum. Considering together the five Western 
Balkan countries with visa-free regime (Ser-
bia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
Albania and the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia), they represent the largest pro-
portion of asylum applicants in the EU (re-

maining at a steady level of 25 802 in 2012 and 
25 600 in 2013). In 2013, they went mostly to 
Germany (16 092). With regard to this flow, 
concerned Member States undertook meas-
ures intended to reduce or mitigate both push 
factors in the countries of origin and pull fac-
tors in destination countries.
According to an ad hoc report produced by 
EASO on this flow**, specific measures con-
cerning pull factors included prioritisation of 
asylum applications from the relevant coun-
tries of origin, engaging additional staff (or 
staff normally in charge of other tasks) to 
manage specific caseloads, shortening of 
processing times, applying accelerated pro-
cedures, reduction or change in format of 
benefits provided during the process (in 
particular by reducing cash benefits) and 
strengthened voluntary or forced return pro-
grammes. Lists of safe countries of origin re-
main an important tool in managing certain 
caseloads, whereby applications submitted 
by applicants from such a country of origin 
are typically being processed in an acceler-
ated manner, for Member States who use 
those types of procedures.
Measures concerning push factors included 
high level visits and initiatives to develop mi-
gration partnership aiming at a more com-
prehensive approach to migration; local visits 
and information campaigns aimed at clarify-
ing the misconceptions of potential applicants 
regarding the intended destination country.
EASO highlighted in its report that the com-
bination of short processing time and lowered 
cash benefits seemed to bring most change 
in terms of lowering the number of applica-
tions filed in a Member States.
The topic of multiple applications in various 
Member States falls directly under the Dub-
lin procedures and related statistics collected 
by Eurostat. Unfortunately, statistics are not 
very informative since they are not disag-

gregated by citizenship. The lack of cohort 
statistics on international protection also 
means that decision figures and asylum ap-
plications cannot be compared. Indeed, the 
delay for examining a claim and issuing a de-
cision are significant and vary widely among 
EU States. As a consequence, the decisions 
issued throughout 2013 do not systematically 
relate to claims lodged in 2013 and both indi-
cators need to be interpreted with caution.

3.3.2. Detections of illegal stay
Through Frontex Risk Analysis Network 
(FRAN), Member States also report on the 
number of third-country nationals who have 
been detected by Member State authorities 
while not fulfilling, or no longer fulfilling, the 
conditions for stay or residence, whether they 
were detected inland or while trying to exit 
the territory.
The number of detections of illegal stay in-
cludes third-country nationals who are not in 
the possession of a valid visa, residence per-
mit, travel document etc., or being in breach 
of a decision to leave the country. It also in-
cludes third-country nationals who initially 
entered legally but overstayed their permis-
sion to stay.
In 2013, there were 344 888 detections of ille-
gal stay in the EU, which represents a gener-
ally stable trend compared to the year before 
and the recent reporting periods. This is con-
sistent with a stable but slightly declining 
long-term trend over the past five years. In 
2008, there were 441 237 detections of ille-
gal stay, or 28% more than in 2013.
In the following analysis of detections of il-
legal stay, it has to be kept in mind that the 
Netherlands, for 2012 and 2013, due to techni-
cal reasons, only reported detections on exit 
and not detections made inland, which in 2011 
amounted to about 6 000. Also in Sweden, 
for administrative reasons, many asylum ap-
plicants were also reported as illegal stayers, 
raising the total number of detections of il-
legal stay in Sweden. Finally, detections for 
Croatia (1 397) corresponded to detections 
between July and December 2013, after the 
country joined the EU.
The overall stable trends masked large dif-
ference between Member States. Germany 
continued to rank first and also reported the 
highest absolute increase. Most of the in-
crease was due to increase in detections of 
Russians and Syrians. The second largest in-
crease in volume was reported by Bulgaria, 
mostly of Syrians. This increase coincided 
with an increase in detections of illegal bor-
der-crossing and asylum applications.
But several Member States also reported very 
large decreases, notably Greece where de-
tections dropped by 41% between 2012 and 
2013. The decrease was also significant in 
Italy, where detections dropped by 22% be-
tween 2012 and 2013.
The vast majority of illegal stayers were de-
tected inland (290 978 detections, or 84% of 
the total) and so are presumed to be long-
term over stayers as they were making no at-
tempt to leave at the time of detection. The 
next most common location for detections 
of illegal stayers was those exiting at the air 
(30 883 detections or 9% of the total) followed 
by the land borders (17 677 detections, or 5%) 
whereby illegally staying migrants were leav-
ing the EU or the Schengen area.
In terms of nationalities, the large number of 
Syrians detected staying illegally is artificially 
inflated by detections in Sweden which in-
cludes people not meeting requirements for 
staying in Sweden before they apply for asy-
lum. Looking at detections in the past few 
years, Moroccans stand out as one the main 
nationalities detected staying illegally (above 
20 000 annual detections between 2009 and 
2013), although their detections at the exter-
nal borders remain much lower. This tends to 
indicate that Moroccans tend to cross legally 
the external borders, but then overstay their 
legal period of stay within the EU. The same 
applies to Algerians, although in lower num-
ber (above 10 000 annual detections for ille-
gal stay between 2009 and 2013). Afghans also 
stand out as among the top nationalities since 
2009, but are showing a decreasing trend, 
with 38 637 detections in 2009 and 16 836 de-
tections in 2013. The decreasing trend in de-
Frontex · annual risk analysis 2014
52 of 80
tections for staying illegally coincides with a 
decreasing trend in detections at the border, as 
well as a decrease in applications for asylum.
3.3.3. Returns
In terms of data on return of third-country 
nationals in third-countries, the first set re-
fers to Member States decisions to return 
third-country nationals and the second set 
concerns effectively carried out returns. The 
number of decisions to return has tradition-
ally been much lower than that of effective 
returns due to a number of factors, such as 
the fact that a number of decisions in some 
Member States are issued to persons who are 
not staying legally but then apply for asylum, 
and are thus not returned.
Data on returns focus on return to third-
countries, and exclude readmissions of 
third-country nationals carried out between 
Member States.
Decisions to return
In 2013, there were 224 305 third-country na-
tionals subject to an obligation to leave the EU 
as a result of an administrative or judicial de-
cision, which was a 17% decrease compared to 
2012. The absolute total number of migrants 
subject to return decisions is still underesti-
mated by this indicator, as data on decisions 
were unavailable from, inter alia, France and 
the Netherlands, while Sweden,  which is as-
sumed to have issued high numbers of deci-
sions, only reported effective returns.
Much of the change between 2012 and 2013 
was due to a decrease in return decisions by 
Greece (-49 % between 2012 and 2013). This 
decrease is in line with decreases reported by 
Greece in detections of illegal border-crossing 
(-46%) and of illegally staying persons (-40%). 
By contrast, return decisions significantly in-
creased in the UK, which ranked first in 2013, 
as well as in Austria.
Effective returns
In 2013, there was a steady trend of 160 699 
third-country nationals effectively returned 
to outside the EU. The UK was the Member 
State conducting the highest number of re-
turns, with steady trends of returned Indians 
and Pakistanis. Greece reported an increase 
in effective returns, mostly of Albanians fol-
lowing their increased detections for ille-
gal border-crossing in 2013. Effective returns 
nearly doubled in Bulgaria, in the wake of the 
increased detections of illegal border-cross-
ing at the land border with Turkey.
Type of effective return
It is difficult to evaluate the overall cost-ef-
fectiveness of return measures in compari-
son with other practical measures taken to 
reduce irregular migration. However, forced 
returns are recognised as being more costly 
than voluntary returns, although Member 
States highlight the importance of return 
flights (including those co-ordinated by Fron-
tex) in ensuring an effective return, as well 
as having a deterrent effect for future irreg-
ular migrants.*

Within the number of effective returns to

the UK and France accounted for nearly half 
of the forced returns. As in 2012, most of the 
forced returns in 2013 concerned Albanians 
returned by Greece, followed by Pakistanis.
3.3.4. Detections of facilitators
Overall detections of facilitators fell by 10% 
between 2012 and 2013, from 7 720 to 6 902. 
This decrease is consistent with a more gen-
eral long-term decreasing trend in detec-
tions of facilitators of irregular migration. In 
2008 and 2009, there were more than 9 000 
such detections.
According to some reports, this long-term de-
cline may in part be due to a widespread shift 
towards the abuse of legal channels and doc-
ument fraud to gain entry to the EU, which 
results in facilitators being able to operate 
remotely and inconspicuously rather than 
accompanying migrants during high-risk ac-
tivities such as border-crossing.
Member States tend to detect more domes-
tic facilitators than any other nationality; in 
2013, all of the top three reporting countries 
for this indicator reported their own citizens 
as facilitators more frequently than any other 
single nationality. Among the countries re-
porting the most facilitators this propen-
sity was strongest in Italy and Spain, where 
about a third of all detected facilitators were 
of their own nationality. In France, domes-
tic facilitators accounted for about a fifth of 
all detections.
Facilitation of illegal immigration consists 
of three aspects or sub-phenomena: (1) fa-
cilitation of irregular migrants entry to the 
EU via the EU external borders; (2) facilita-
tion of irregular migrants secondary move-
ments within the EU (within the Schengen 
area or between Schengen and the EU); and 
(3) facilitation of migration status transition 
of irregular migrants within the EU, i.e. the 
legalisation of their residence status. Organ-
ised crime groups can be involved in any of 
the three areas.

1.  European Commissions 
priorities in 2014
a)  Fight against trafficking in human 
beings
In the context of the implementation of the 
EU Strategy towards the Eradication of Traf-
ficking in Human Beings and the implemen-
tation of the Joint Statement of the Head of 
the EU Justice and Home Affairs agencies, 
the European Commission reflects on the 
following issues regarding trafficking in hu-
man beings:
n  Early identification of victims is of pri-
mary importance in the EU legal and po-
litical framework. In September 2013, the 
European Commission published a Refer-
ence Document on Guidelines on the Identifica-
tion of Victims of Trafficking in Human Beings 
addressed especially to border guards and 
consular services. This Reference Docu-
ment was based on Frontex Anti-trafficking 
Training for Border Guards  Trainers Manual 
and the Handbook for Diplomatic and Consu-
lar Personnel on how to Assist and Protect Vic-
tims of Human Trafficking (produced by the 
Council of the Baltic Sea States  CBSS).
n  The European Commission has also funded 
a project that will develop guidelines for 
better identification of victims, taking into 
account the EC / ILO 2009 lists of indicators 
on trafficking of human beings, in order 
to facilitate a more harmonised approach 
and to improve identification.
  The first evaluation report of the EU Strat-
egy towards the Eradication of Traffick-
ing in Human Beings will be published by 
the European Commission in mid-2014.
b)  Improving the knowledge regarding 
irregular secondary movements of 
third-country nationals within the EU
The Council has identified strategic priority 
areas where efforts need to be stepped up 
and monitored in relation to irregular immi-
gration. Under one of those strategic priority 
areas, a number of goals are listed, including 
Strengthening identification of illegal im-
migration routes inside the Schengen area. 
Member States generally agree that there is 
a need for better data collection and analy-
sis, that the Commission should play a role 
in this and that existing structures should be 
used to the greatest extent possible.
Three groups of third-country nationals in-
volved in secondary movements within the 
Schengen area could be distinguished: (a) mi-
grants who have entered illegally; (b) mi-
grants who have entered legally but are no 
longer entitled to stay in the Schengen area 
(overstayers); and (c) asylum seekers (who 
have moved to another Member State from 
the one where they have initially submitted 
their application).
© Frontex, 2012
4. Environmental scan
55 of 80
Following more than a year of preparatory 
work, the Frontex Risk Analysis Network 
agreed in December 2013 on indicators of 
these movements to be regularly collected 
as of January 2014. The knowledge gathered 
through the regular data collection and the 
analytical follow up, should feed into the as-
sessment of the functioning of the Schengen 
area and to the strategic level discussion on 
possible measures aimed at countering un-
authorised secondary movements of third-
country nationals within the EU.
2.  Implementation of 
Objective 4 of the Internal 
Security Strategy
a)  The second generation of the 
Schengen Information System (SIS II)
The focus for the Commission in 2014 / 2015 
will be to monitor correct implementation 
by Member States of all SIS II functionalities 
(new data categories, linking between alert, 
European Arrest Warrant  (EAW), photo-
graphs). Also, the European Commission will 
present a report on the use of fingerprints in 
SIS II in accordance with Article 22(c) of the 
legal basis. Finally, the Commission will fol-
low up the integration of possible new Mem-
ber States and Europol.
b)  The roll-out and impact of Visa 
Information System (VIS)
The VIS will be rolled out, region by region, 
until all Schengen states consulates world-
wide are connected. The global roll-out will 
take at least until spring 2015. So far, the VIS 
has started operations in North Africa in 
October 2011, in the Near East in May 2012, 
in the Gulf region, in October 2012, in West 
and Central Africa in March 2013, in East and 
Southern Africa in June 2013, in South America 
in September 2013 and in Central and South 
East Asia and in the occupied Palestinian Ter-
ritory in November 2013.
The following tentative dates have so far been 
agreed for the roll-out in 2014:
n  15 May 2014: Central America, North 
America, the Caribbean, Australasia
n  25 September 2014: Western Balkans and 
Turkey, the Eastern neighbouring countries
However a few Member States consider they 
might need more time for the roll-out in 
countries such as Ukraine and Belarus. The 
roll-out for the remaining regions will not 
take place before 2015.
State of play of entry / exit system and 
registered traveller programme
The Smart Borders Package will re-exam-
ine and test both a detailed design of the 
technical architecture and the underlying 
operational processes. Its objective will be 
to ensure that the best possible choices are 
made both from a technical and cost-benefit 
point of view, taking into account the need 
for a high level of data protection.
c) EUROSUR Regulation
On 2 December 2013 the European Border 
Surveillance System (EUROSUR) became op-
erational. EUROSUR will be operational in 30 
countries in total. In this first phase, it will be-
come operational in 19 countries, the 18 EU 
Member States at the southern and east-
ern external borders and the Schengen As-
sociated Country Norway. As of 1 December 
2014, another eight EU Member States and 
three Schengen Associated Countries will join 
EUROSUR. Ireland and the UK do not take 
part in the Schengen cooperation and there-
fore also not involved in EUROSUR.
The backbone of EUROSUR is formed by na-
tional coordination centres, via which all na-
tional authorities with a responsibility for 
border surveillance (e.g. border guard, po-
lice, coast guard, navy) are required to co-
operate and to coordinate their activities.

Information on incidents occurring at the ex-
ternal land and sea borders, the status and 
position of patrols as well as analytical re-
ports and intelligence are being shared via 
national situational pictures among these 
national authorities.
This cooperation and information exchange 
allows the concerned Member State to re-
act much faster to any incidents concerning 
irregular migration and cross-border crime 
or relating to a risk to the lives of migrants.
Frontex plays an important role in bringing 
together and analysing in the European sit-
uational picture information collected by 
Member States, thereby detecting changing 
routes or new methods used by criminal net-
works. This European situational picture also 
contains information collected during Frontex 
joint operations and on the pre-frontier area. 
Furthermore, Frontex cooperates with other 
EU agencies, such as the European Maritime 
Safety Agency and the EU Satellite Centre.
3.  The new Internal Security 
Fund and financing in the 
area of Home Affairs for the 
period 20142020
The final text of the ISF Borders was agreed 
between the three institutions in Decem-
ber 2013. Despite important cuts in the initial 
budget, the main features of this instrument 
proposed by the Commission have remained 
in the final text. The global resources for 
the implementation between 2014 and 2020 
(seven years) will be EUR 2 760 million, of 
which 1 551 shall be allocated to the Mem-
ber States. The main features of the funds 
are described below:
n  support and reinforce the national capa-
bilities in the area of border control and 
visa policy and thus expressing financial 
solidarity with the tasks entrusted to in-
dividual Member States at external bor-
ders and in consulates in the interest of 
the border-free area as a public service 
provided to the Union;
n  finance the development of the smart bor-
der package, i.e. the setting up of an EU 
Entry / Exit System (EES) and an EU Reg-
istered Traveller Programme (RTP);
n  finance the introduction and operation of 
the European Border Surveillance System, 
EUROSUR, notably through the purchase 
of equipment, infrastructure and systems 
in Member States;
n  reinforce the Schengen governance and 
the evaluation and monitoring mechanism 
to verify the application of the Schengen 
acquis by (a) funding the operation of that 
mechanism under direct management; 
(b) introducing conditionalities based on 
compliance with the Schengen acquis 
for the disbursement of operating sup-
port to Member States and (c) requiring 
Member States to (re)allocate resources 
received for programmes under this in-
strument with priority to remedy weak-
nesses if these have been identified under 
the mechanism;
n  boost the operational potential of the 
Frontex Agency by inviting Member States 
to earmark additional resources under 
their programmes for specialised equip-
ment which can be put at the disposal of 
the Agency for its Joint Operations;
n  support the development and implemen-
tation of the relevant Union policies in 
the EU, in and with third countries under 
Union actions, thus improving the over-
all management of migration flows to the 
Union (projects managed either directly, 
such as studies or pilot projects to rein-
force co-operation with third countries, 
or indirectly, in accordance with the Fi-
nancial Regulation);
57 of 80
n  have readily available adequate resources 
to provide emergency assistance in case 
of situations of urgent or exceptional mi-
gratory pressure;
n  continue support for the functioning of 
the Specific Transit Scheme for Lithua-
nia, in accordance with the obligations 
of the EU, providing support to compen-
sate for foregone fees from transit visas 
and additional costs incurred by Lithua-
nia in implementing the Facilitated Tran-
sit Document (FTD) and Facilitated Rail 
Transit Document (FRTD) scheme, such 
as replacing and upgrading equipment, IT 
systems, training and operational costs.
4.  The Schengen Governance 
legislative package
Already in mid-September 2011, the Com-
mission presented a communication enti-
tled Schengen Governance  strengthening 
the area without internal border control. The 
package contained two legislative proposals, a 
regulation on the establishment of an evalua-
tion and monitoring mechanism to verify the 
application of the Schengen acquis (10597 / 13) 
and one an amendment to the Schengen Bor-
ders Code as regards the rules for the tem-
porary reintroduction of border controls at 
internal borders in exceptional circumstances 
(PE-CO S 30 / 13). The package that aims to be 
the EUs response to potential derogations 
and restrictions to liberty of circulation was 
finally adopted in October 2013.
a) Schengen evaluation mechanism
The revision of the Schengen evaluation 
mechanism is quite extensive. Increased im-
portance of the Commission and significantly 
enhanced follow-up procedures regarding 
how identified deficiencies in any Member 
State should be remedied are two most strik-
ing changes.
Also, Schengen evaluations now cover all as-
pects of the Schengen acquis, including the 
absence of border controls at internal borders 
and can also be conducted as unannounced 
on-site visits. Importantly, recommendations 
from Frontex annual risk analysis will be taken 
into account by the Commission when draft-
ing annual evaluation programmes and de-
ciding on unannounced on-site visits.
b)  Reintroduction of border control  
at internal borders
Schengen states reserve their severing right 
to unilaterally reintroduce internal border 
controls. The main novelties are linked to du-
ration, geographic scope and procedure to be 
followed when a Member State wishes to re-
introduce internal border controls.
Namely, the amendments stipulate that re-
introduction of border control is also possi-
ble for specific parts of internal border and 
not just the entire border section in ques-
tion. This solution reflects the reality of the 
situation since border controls are often only 
Procedure for reintroducing border control  
at internal borders
[Member] States which want to reinstate border control must 
provide details of the situation to the Commission and its part-
ners and, if required, convince them of the necessity of such 
measures through joint meetings. This explanation process 
carries three major consequences. Firstly, the new measures 
strongly restrict Member States discretionary powers. Or, 
from a different angle, the Member States safeguard clause 
is subject to a powerful instance of communitisation. Further, 
the amendment gives the Commission and the Member States 
the opportunity to appeal to the Court of Justice when, for 
instance, a state reintroduces border control without having 
convinced its partners of the necessity and proportionality.

necessary at a certain section of the internal 
border in question.
They also clarify the maximum duration for 
which border control may be reintroduced, 
whether it is for foreseeable events (up to 
six months) or in an emergency (up to two 
months). Importantly, an obligation for Mem-
ber States to provide more specific reasoning 
behind the reintroduction of internal bor-
ders is also a novelty worth mentioning (see 
box for details).
Probably the most important change is linked 
to specific measures in the case of serious 
deficiencies relating to the external border 
controls. Namely, if evaluation report under 
the Schengen evaluation mechanism con-
cludes that a Member State has been seri-
ously neglecting its obligations, the Council 
may on the basis of a Commission proposal 
recommend that one or more specific Mem-
ber States reintroduce border controls at all or 
specific parts of the internal borders. In such 
extreme case, the Councils initiative (recom-
mendation and not obligation) is considered 
as a last resort.
5.  Schengen visa policy 
developments
In the first half of 2014 it is expected that 
the visa-free regime will be applicable with 
Moldova, after the country is transferred to 
the visa-free list of Regulation 539 / 2001. If 
the visa-free regime would lead to abuses, 
then the new suspension mechanism could 
be triggered.
An additional 19 countries (16 Pacific and Car-
ibbean island nations, the United Arab Emir-
ates, Peru and Colombia) will probably be 
transferred to the visa-free list of Regulation 
539 / 2001 in April 2014, but visa-free travel will 
need to wait until the negotiation and entry 
into force of visa waiver agreements with 
each of these countries  which means prob-
ably until 2015 at least. Moreover, the nego-
tiations for the visa waiver agreements with 
Peru and Colombia will only start after the 
Commission presents a positive assessment 
of the risks involved, particularly in terms of 
irregular migration and security. It is unlikely 
that the move to grant visa-free status to the 
16 Caribbean and Pacific island nations and 
to the UAE will bring any additional risks in 
terms of migration and security.
Towards the end of the year 2014, the Com-
mission may propose a new revision of the 
lists of countries of Regulation 539 / 2001, us-
ing a new methodology that will take into 
account not only the traditional security and 
irregular immigration criteria but also eco-
nomic and human rights considerations.
Touring visa
In March 2014, the European Commission will 
present a proposal recasting and amending 
the Visa Code and a proposal to establish a 
new touring visa, allowing to circulate in the 
Schengen area for more than 90 days per 180 
days without staying longer than 90 days in 
one Schengen state. Due to upcoming Euro-
pean elections, this proposal will be adopted 
by the co-legislators not before 2015.
6.  Possible evocation of the so-
called Visa safeguard clause 
by Member States already in 
2014
The visa suspension mechanism has been 
available to Member States since 9 Janu-
ary 2014. Member States can now request 
the Commission to temporarily suspend the 
visa-free regime with a third country when 
at least one of the criteria listed in Regula-
tion 1289 / 2013 is met (see box).
The European Commission is aware of the 
still worrying numbers of unfounded asylum 
applications from citizens of some Western 
59 of 80
Balkan countries in some Member States, in 
particular in Germany.
7. Revised Dublin Regulation
On 29 June 2013, the EC Regulation 343 / 2003, 
known as Dublin II, was recast. The new reg-
ulation, Regulation (EU) No 604 / 2013, known 
as Dublin III, was jointly adopted by the Eu-
ropean Parliament and the European Council. 
This new regulation, applicable as of 1 January 
2014, intends to harmonise practices already 
in place in the Member States and improve 
the asylum system efficiency.
The new regulation establishes more concrete 
criteria and clarifies which Member State is 
responsible for examining an application for 
international protection.
It also contains more provisions to protect the 
applicants as a new right to information for 
asylum applicants and the compulsory obli-
gation to a personal interview. New clauses 
concerning childrens rights and family re-
unification were also introduced, in order to 
guarantee the minors best interests and bet-
ter ensure family reunification.
There was also a strong emphasis concern-
ing the fundamental rights covered by this 
new regulation. In this regard, it contains a 
new provision on judicial remedies for asy-
lum seekers to challenge the Dublin decisions 
where transfers would not be in compliance 
with their fundamental rights and there was 
the risk of inhuman or degrading treatment.
According to the European Commission, the 
new regulation will have no or no significant 
impacts on the distribution of the asylum ap-
plications. The principles of the system remain 
the same in the recast, and, most importantly, 
the main criteria for establishing the Member 
State responsible remain unchanged.
According to UNHCR, the recast statutes, 
which will require extensive transposition at 
the national level in 2014, strengthen protec-
tion standards. However, discrepancies in im-
plementation persist, leading to protection 
gaps in some countries and posing challenges 
to the functioning of the Common European 
Asylum System. These include challenges in 
the application of the Dublin III Regulation, 
which determines which Member State is re-
sponsible for examining an asylum application.
Criteria from Regulation 1289 / 2013
Article 1a
A Member State may notify the Commission if it is confronted, 
over a six-month period, in comparison with the same period 
in the previous year or with the last six months prior to the im-
plementation of the exemption from the visa requirement for 
nationals of a third country listed in Annex II, with one or more 
of the following circumstances leading to an emergency situ-
ation which it is unable to remedy on its own, namely a sub-
stantial and sudden increase in the number of:
(a)  nationals of that third country found to be staying in the 
Member States territory without a right thereto;
(b)  asylum applications from the nationals of that third coun-
try for which the recognition rate is low, where such an 
increase is leading to specific pressures on the Member 
States asylum system;
(c)  rejected readmission applications submitted by the Mem-
ber State to that third country for its own nationals.
The comparison with the six-month period prior to the im-
plementation of the exemption from the visa requirement as 
referred to in the first subparagraph shall only be applicable 
during a period of seven years from the date of implemen-
tation of the exemption from the visa requirement for na-
tionals of that third country.

Eurodac changes
Until recently the Eurodac database could 
only be used for asylum purposes. How-
ever, the European Commissions proposal 
to recast the Eurodac Regulation (603 / 2013) 
includes an extension to the scope of the 
Regulation in order to allow law-enforce-
ment authorities in Member States as well as 
Europol to compare latent fingerprints from 
crime scenes with Eurodac fingerprint data 
for the purpose of preventing, detecting and 
investigating serious crimes and terrorism.
According to the legislation there are several 
restrictions to use the information stored in 
the Eurodac system*:
n  Limited searches only to the most serious 
crimes, such as murder and terrorism;
n  Law-enforcement authorities must under-
take a comparison of fingerprints against 
the Visa Information System (where 
permitted);
n  Law-enforcement checks may not be 
made in a systematic way, but only as a 
last resort when all the conditions for ac-
cess are fulfilled;
n  No data received from Eurodac may be 
shared with third countries.
Entry into force and impact on 
distribution of asylum applications
The recast Eurodac Regulation will be appli-
cable from 20 July 2015. According to the Eu-
ropean Commission, it will have no impact on 
the changes on distribution of asylum appli-
cations or secondary movements, but there is 
a change concerning persons who have been 
granted international protection. Until now, if 
someone applies for asylum, it has not been 
possible to check whether they were previ-
ously granted protection in another Member 
State. From the mentioned date onwards, it 
will be possible for a Member State to see if 
the person already has a status elsewhere 
and, if so, it should be possible to return that 
* http://ec.europa.eu/
dgs/home-affairs/what-
we-do/policies/asylum/
identification-of-applicants/
index_en.htm
person to the Member State that granted 
protection.
8.  EU Readmission Agreements 
 state of play regarding new 
agreements
According to the information provided by 
the European Commission, the Readmis-
sion Agreement with Turkey was signed on 
16 December 2013 and will enter into force 
once the European Parliament gives its con-
sent and the Turkish Parliament ratifies it.
A Readmission Agreement with Azerbaijan 
was initialled in July 2013. Preparations for the 
signature are being made, after which entry 
into force is expected to follow without delay.
Negotiation of the Readmission Agreement 
with Morocco is expected to be re-launched 
soon. The parallel negotiation of a Visa Fa-
cilitation Agreement, as part of the EU-Mo-
rocco Mobility Partnership, should break the 
current deadlock. A similar process is fore-
seen for Tunisia, although negotiating di-
rectives for a Readmission Agreement have 
not yet been recommended to the Council.
Readmission negotiations with Belarus were 
officially launched on 29 January 2014, follow-
ing an initial invitation to open negotiations 
in 2011. A first round of technical negotia-
tions is expected to be held in March 2014. 
The course and length of negotiations is, ac-
cording to the European Commission, diffi-
cult to predict, though the parallel negotiation 
of Visa Facilitation Agreement is expected to 
facilitate the process. For comparison, the 
agreement with Armenia, which is the most 
recent to enter into force, required a period 
of around 20 months from the start of nego-
tiations until entry into force.

Analysis of Eurodac hits data for 2012
The Eurodac statistics are based on records of (1) fingerprints from all individuals aged 
14 years or over who have made applications for asylum in the Member States (cat-
egory 1), (2) fingerprints of persons who were apprehended when crossing a Mem-
ber States external border irregularly (category 2), or (3) persons who were found 
illegally present on the territory of a Member State (in case the competent authori-
ties consider it necessary to check a potential prior asylum application) (category 3).
In 2012, a total of 34.4% of all multiple applications were local hits* (down from 
38.6% in 2011). In a number of Member States (Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech 
Republic, Spain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, the UK) this fig-
ure even exceeds 50%. In the case of Belgium, local hits accounted for 10 037 of the 
14 883 applications (67.4%) and in Cyprus local hits accounted for 139 of the 148 ap-
plications (93.9%).
Foreign hits** give an indication of the secondary movements of asylum seekers in 
the EU. As in previous years, the statistics confirm that the secondary movements 
witnessed do not necessarily follow the logical routes between neighbouring Mem-
ber States. For instance, France continued to receive the highest number of foreign 
hits from asylum seekers who previously lodged an application in Poland (2 498). 
Germany and Switzerland received a high number of asylum seekers who had pre-
viously lodged an application in Sweden (2 567 and 1 050, respectively). The statis-
tics show, as in previous years, that foreign hits are not a one-way street from the 
countries with an external land border or those bordering the Mediterranean to the 
more northerly Member States.
When comparing 2012 with 2011 an increase from 21% to 65.3% can be observed in 
the number of cases of persons apprehended in connection with an irregular bor-
der-crossing who later decide to lodge an asylum claim. This reflects an increase in 
absolute terms from 7 384 in 2011 to 17 319 in 2012.
The majority of those who entered the EU illegally via Italy and moved on, travelled 
to Switzerland (2 978), Germany (1 359) or Sweden (881). Those who moved on after 
having entered illegally via Greece mainly went to Germany (2 168), Sweden (1 612) 
or Austria (1 216). Of those entering via Spain, most moved on to either France (410), 
Germany (284), Belgium (259) or Switzerland (242), while those who moved on after 
having had their fingerprints taken in Hungary mainly moved on to the neighbour-
ing countries of Germany (61) or Austria (59). 
*  Local hits are cases where a person making an asylum application in a Member State is discovered to have 
previously applied for asylum in the same Member State.
*  Foreign hits are cases where a person making an asylum application in a Member State is discovered to 
have previously applied for asylum or detected for illegal border-crossing in another Member State.

This chapter reviews the possible evolution 
of the situation along the external border of 
the EU in the coming years. While some de-
velopments are likely to materialise, others 
seem possible, based on current knowledge. 
Finally, past experiences demonstrate that 
there are a large number of unforeseeable 
events and factors that can have a profound 
and unpredictable impact on the situation 
at the border.
5.1. The likely
The best forecasts  those likely to material-
ise and have a direct bearing on the situation 
at the external borders  are the continued 
use of the Mediterranean area as the main 
crossing points for irregular migration, and 
the growing workload of border-control au-
thorities due to growth of passengers flows 
and the introduction in October 2014 of com-
pulsory biometric check on VIS Schengen 
visa holders. At the same time, border-con-
trol authorities are increasingly expected to 
be engaged in search and rescue operations 
covering vast areas of the Mediterranean 
Sea, as well as being the first interlocutors 
for a growing number of persons present-
ing themselves at the EU borders in search 
of international protection. Budget environ-
ment is expected to remain tight over the 
next few years.
5.1.1.  Illegal border-crossing expected to 
remain concentrated in southern 
and south-eastern borders of the EU
Based on the location of the main countries 
of origin for irregular migration to the EU for 
the past five years, the border areas that are 
most likely to deal with illegal border-crossing 
remain the Southern Mediterranean coast, 
and the borders with Turkey. Migrants living 
in or having relatively easy / facilitated access 
to Turkey and / or North Africa will continue 
to be overrepresented in the flow of irregu-
lar migrants to the EU. In particular, depar-
tures of sub-Saharan migrants from Libya 
across the Central Mediterranean to reach 
Italy and arrivals of Syrians crossing the bor-
der illegally to apply for asylum in the EU  
two phenomena already present in 2013  are 
likely to continue in the near future.
Southern Mediterranean area
On the Eastern Mediterranean route, en-
hanced surveillance along the Greek land bor-
der with Turkey has resulted in a displacement 
to the Eastern Aegean Sea and the Bulgarian 
land border with Turkey. Displacement to the 
Eastern Aegean Sea is expected to put pres-
sure on the limited local reception facilities 
for undocumented migrants and increase the 
allocation of resources for search and rescue 
operations, as well as increase the possibil-
ity of migrants continuing undetected their 
journey to Western European Member States.
5. Outlook
© Frontex, 2012
63 of 80
The Bulgarian authorities will carry on build-
ing and renovating reception facilities but 
resources are being stretched and migrants 
will continue to consider crossing illegally the 
land border between Turkey and Greece as 
an option to reach their final destinations in 
the EU. Among those migrants, Syrians are 
the most vulnerable and the likelihood of 
humanitarian crisis at the EU border will re-
main significant until the situation in Syria im-
proves. The ability to provide consistent and 
timely measures and actions will be crucial for 
coping with security and humanitarian risks.
In addition, an increasing number of migrants 
from North Africa and the Middle East are ex-
pected to transit to Turkey via the air border, 
before attempting to cross illegally the bor-
der to the EU, including through the use of 
forged document. Istanbul airport (IST) is an 
important hub for irregular migrants travel-
ling by air route to several Member States, 
with continuous increase in passenger flows 
for the past few years and airline carriers ex-
pansion towards Africa and the Middle East. 
Turkish airports are thus likely to remain com-
mon embarking points for irregular migrants 
arriving in the EU.
Central Mediterranean area
In the Central Mediterranean, many areas on 
the North African coasts may be used as de-
parture points for illegal border-crossing to 
the EU. At the end of 2013, departures from 
Libya were increasing, but Egypt and Tunisia 
also offer crossing options for potential mi-
grants. North African countries may be used 
as transit countries for migrants from more 
southern African countries to sail across the 
Mediterranean. They may be used as tran-
sit by migrants from many different origins, 
which complicate further predictions in terms 
of volume.
The increasing detections of illegal border-
crossing in the Central Mediterranean, along 
with the increasing complexity of irregular 
arrivals are expected to absorb a significant 
proportion of resources. The broadening of 
the surveillance area results in border as-
sets being increasing mobilised in support 
of search and rescues activities.
5.1.2. Increased workload at the border
Regular passenger flows across the external 
border will increase significantly in the com-
ing years due to rising global mobility. Visa 
liberalisation processes and local border traf-
fic agreements are placing also increasing re-
sponsibilities on border-control authorities.
Air travel environment is becoming more 
complex with the growth of low-cost carriers. 
Also the advances in travel complexity and 
growing sophistication of criminal activities 
generate increasing workloads for border-
control officers and difficulties in developing 
risk assessments of planes and passengers.
In addition, the EU continues to receive a 
high number of asylum seekers. A substan-
tial number of economic migrants appear 
to use the asylum procedure to try entering 
or staying on the territory of the EU. Their 
first interlocutors are often border-control 
authorities.
5.1.3.  VIS implemented at BCPs in 
October 2014
The Visa Information System (VIS) is a system 
for the exchange of information on short-stay 
visas between Member States. The VIS was 
established via Council Decision 2004 / 512 / EC 
of 8 June 2004. The main objectives of the 
VIS are to facilitate visa application proce-
dures and checks at the external borders and 
to enhance security. The VIS facilitates the 
exchange of data between Schengen states 
on visa applications in order to ease proce-
dures, prevent visa shopping and assist in 
the fight against fraud.
Frontex · annual risk analysis 2014
64 of 80
The VIS became operational on 11 October 
2011. The start of the VIS operations has had 
major consequences for the EUs border au-
thorities. By the end of the transitional period, 
three years after VIS began, i.e. in October 
2014, all Schengen Member States will be re-
quired to be able to carry out VIS fingerprint 
verifications at all BCPs and also be able to 
issue VIS visas with biometrics at the border 
when necessary.
The obligation for consulates to exchange visa 
data follows a roll-out calendar established 
for 23 regions of the world (see Fig. 25). At the 
end of 2013, consulates in 11 regions were al-
ready using the VIS. Data on visas issued in 
2013 is not yet available, but together these 
11 regions represented 23% of all visas issued 
in 2012. The roll-out will continue throughout 
2014, but definite dates have not yet been de-
termined by the Council. Member States are 
still debating on the most practical way to 
roll-out the VIS in regions representing the 
bulk of short-term visa application and is-
suance, in particular the Russian Federation 
(Region 18), alone representing 42% of all vi-
sas issued in 2012.
The VIS Regulation (Article 18) provides the 
border guards carrying out border checks 
at the external borders with access to con-
sult the VIS data. This access is for the sole 
purpose of verifying the identity of the visa 
holder, the authenticity of the visa and / or 
whether the conditions for entry to the ter-
ritory of the Member States are fulfilled.
Figure 25. VIS was rolled-out in eleven regions in 20112013. The roll-out will continue with the remaining twelve 
regions adopting VIS during 2014 and 2015, although no dates have yet been agreed on

During the initial period, between October 
2011 and October 2014, this verification can 
either be accomplished with the visa sticker 
number (VSN) or with the VSN in combina-
tion with the fingerprints of the holder. After 
October 2014, the verification will be accom-
plished with the visa sticker number (VSN) 
in combination with the fingerprints of the 
holder, unless exceptional circumstances (for 
instance due to the intensity of traffic) mean 
that in accordance with the Schengen Bor-
ders Code the visa holder is exempted from 
fingerprinting.
Thus, as of October 2014, the workload for 
border-control authorities will increase sig-
nificantly. Based on available statistics on 
Schengen visas issued in 2012, and assuming 
that VIS roll-out took place in Regions 12 to 17, 
it can be estimated that about 500 000 VIS 
Schengen visas will be issued and will thus 
have to be checked by border control. This 
estimate does not take into account passen-
gers travelling on multiple entry visas, who 
can cross the border several times within a 
six-month period.
Eventually, in 2015, assuming that the VIS roll-
out takes place in Regions 18 to 23, including 
in the Russian Federation, China and Turkey, 
the number of VIS visas issued every month 
can be estimated at about 1.2 million.
While there were some discussions in 2013 
about granting visa-free travel for Russian 
citizens, an option that would have consid-
erably changed the impact of the VIS rollout, 
at an extraordinary meeting on 6 March 2014, 
the European Council (EU heads of state or 
government) decided to suspend bilateral 
talks with the Russian Federation on visa 
matters. This means that, at the time of writ-
ing, visa-free travel for Russian citizens has 
been postponed indefinitely.
The Schengen Borders Code does not cur-
rently impose mandatory consultation of the 
VIS on exit. However, a thorough check on 
exit comprises, among other things, a veri-
fication that the person is in possession of a 
valid visa, if required, and it may include con-
sultation with the VIS in accordance with Ar-
ticle 18 of the VIS Regulation.
It is important to stress that VIS is a tool for 
border guards, but the VIS result alone is not 
sufficient to refuse entry. When an issue is 
spotted during first-line check, passengers 
must still be sent to second-line checks for 
additional verification and final decision.
5.1.4. Budget cuts
The economic crisis led to reductions in pub-
lic funding in many Member States and at the 
EU level. These reductions have already im-
pacted several border-control agencies and 
significant annual savings are to be expected 
over future budgets, which has an impact 
on the capability and capacity to respond to 
challenges faced at the border.
5.2. The possible
5.2.1.  Continued involvement of 
organised crime groups
It is possible that organised crime groups 
(OCGs) will get increasingly involved in the 
facilitation of smuggling of migrants and traf-
ficking in human beings across the EU. There 
are growing reports that facilitators not only 
provide assistance to cross the border ille-
gally, but also facilitate the stay of irregu-
lar migrants in Member States by providing 
fraudulent documents.
However, there remain large uncertainties 
as to the level of organisation that can range 
from very structured enterprises to oppor-
tunistic groups. Little is also known about 
the extent of the connection between the 
smuggling of migrants and trafficking in hu-
man beings. While by definition irregular mi-
Frontex · annual risk analysis 2014
66 of 80
gration is linked to international movements, 
there remain many unknowns as to the in-
ternational dimension of the OCGs involved 
in these activities. Some information point 
to the fact that leader of the OCGs are most 
often of the nationality of the smuggled per-
sons, while other indicate the involvement 
of many opportunistic groups not necessar-
ily specialising in the smuggling of migrants 
from a single nationality.
5.2.2. Document fraud
Given the increasing level of security features 
in modern travel documents and stricter mi-
gration policies across Member States, the 
misuse of genuine travel documents (which 
includes impersonation and fraudulently ob-
tained documents) is likely to be an entry 
method which will steadily rise.
Some of these issues will be addressed by the 
Visa Information System (VIS), which is op-
erational among issuing authorities across 
11 regions as of November 2013, and VIS will 
be rolled-out to additional regions in 2014 
and 2015.
The systematic check on arrivals of VIS visas 
is likely to result in increased abuse of fraud-
ulent breeder documents required to obtain 
genuine VIS, as well as EU passports which 
do not require systematic biometric controls 
at the border. In addition, the use of specific 
fraudulent techniques to deceive biomet-
ric checks, like spoofed fingerprints, is also 
likely to increase.
5.3. The unknown
5.3.1.  Time and composition of irregular 
migration flows
Illegal-migration flows are expected to fol-
low known routes from North Africa and 
the Middle East to the EU, mostly by sea and 
through the south-eastern land border via 
Turkey. The main uncertainties concern the 
timing, as well as the size and composition of 
the flows. The composition and / or the size 
of the flow will vary in response to the de-
veloping situation in North Africa and in the 
Middle East, particularly in Syria and neigh-
bouring countries.
Swift diversification of modi operandi, possi-
ble displacement between routes or border 
types, and escalating attempts to evade de-
tection or identification are all likely to occur 
in response to enhanced surveillance.
5.3.2.  Sudden political and economic 
changes
Political evolutions are hard to predict. There 
is no assurance that another sharp economic 
downturn or social unrest in neighbouring 
countries would not spur irregular migra-
tion. Though economic and social duress had 
long been present in North Africa, the rapid-
ity and extent of the changes brought about 
by the Arab Spring that began in December 
2010 were largely unexpected.
Similarly, another sharp economic downturn 
in the EU, or on the contrary, a strong re-
bound in economic growth and demand for 
labour in the EU, may not be excluded and 
may have considerable influence on irregu-
lar migration to the EU.
5.3.3. Migrants staying illegally in the EU
There is an intelligence gap on the profile of 
persons staying illegally in Member States, 
which prevents border-control authorities 
from effectively assessing entry criteria, in 
particular the assessment for lacking appro-
priate justification for the purpose of stay. In-
deed, the indicator on detections of persons 
staying illegally is strongly influenced by the 
national resources devoted to their detec-
tions. As past experience of regularisation 
programmes has shown, the total number of 
67 of 80
detections may under-represent some cate-
gories of migrants staying illegally but rather 
inconspicuous, like for example Ukrainians 
employed as domestic workers or providing 
care to the elderly.
5.3.4. Threat of terrorists movements
Overall, there is an underlying threat of ter-
rorism-related travel movements especially 
due to the appeal of the Syrian conflict to 
both idealist and radicalised youths. The con-
flict in Syria has attracted hundreds of foreign 
fighters, including EU citizens, dual-national-
ity holders and other third-country nation-
als. Turkey has become the preferred country 
where foreign fighters enter or exit Syria 
primarily because of its geographical loca-
tion plus the availability of legal and cheap 
travel options.
Irrespective of whether avoided or promoted 
by terrorist structures, it is possible that ir-
regular migration routes and/or facilitation 
networks could be utilised especially if the 
associated risks and costs are perceived to 
be low in comparison to other legal travel 
options.
Frontex is not in a position to identify, nor 
does it have any information that suggests, 
any nexus between terrorist travel and ir-
regular migration routings and/or facilitation 
networks. Nonetheless, the following pos-
sibilities cannot be excluded: changes in the 
travelling modi operandi for EU-based fight-
ers after administrative and/or legal meas-
ures upon their return; and the reluctance 
of third-country national fighters to return 
home in fear of reprisal, which may lead them 
to resettle elsewhere.

Notes on FRAN data sources and methods
For the data concerning detections at the ex-
ternal borders, some of the border types are 
not applicable to all FRAN Member States. 
This pertains to data on all FRAN indicators 
since the data are provided disaggregated 
by border type. The definitions of detections 
at land borders are therefore not applica-
ble (excluding borders with non-Schengen 
principalities) for Belgium, the Czech Re-
public, Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland, 
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Neth-
erlands, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and 
the UK. For Cyprus, the land border refers to 
the Green Line demarcation with the area 
not under the effective control of the gov-
ernment of the Republic of Cyprus. For sea 
borders, the definitions are not applicable for 
land-locked Member States including Austria, 
the Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg, 
Slovakia and Switzerland.
In addition, data on detections of illegal bor-
der-crossing at land, air and sea BCPs (1B) are 
not available for Iceland, Ireland and Spain 
and in Greece (these detections are included 
in the data for Indicator 1A). Data for Nor-
way only includes detections of illegal bor-
der-crossing at land and sea BCPs (1B), not 
between BCPs (1A).
In Italy, detections of illegal border-crossing 
at sea BCPs are only reported for intra-EU 
border-crossing from Greece. Data on de-
tections of illegal border-crossing between 
sea BCPs (1A) are not available for Ireland.
Data on apprehension (FRAN Indicator 2) of 
facilitators is not available for Ireland. For It-
aly, the data are not disaggregated by border 
type, but are reported as total apprehen-
sions (not specified). Data for Italy and Nor-
way also include the facilitation of illegal stay 
and work. For Romania, the data include 
land intra-EU detections on exit at the bor-
der with Hungary.
For the data concerning detections of illegal 
stay (FRAN Indicator 3), data on detections 
at exit are not available for Denmark, Ireland, 
Italy, Spain and the UK.
Data on refusals of entry (FRAN Indicator 4) 
at the external EU borders are not disag-
gregated by reason of refusal for Ireland and 
the UK. Refusals of entry at the Spanish land 
borders at Ceuta and Melilla (without the is-
suance of a refusal form) are reported sepa-
rately and are not included in the presented 
FRAN data.
The data on applications for international pro-
tection (FRAN Indicator 5) are not disaggre-
gated by place of application (type of border 
on entry or inland applications) for Austria, 
the Czech Republic and Slovenia. For these 
countries, only the total number of applica-
tions is reported. For France, only asylum 
applications at the external borders are re-
ported, not inland applications. For the UK, 
data reported for applications at air BCPs also 
include applications at sea BCPs.
The data on return decisions issued (FRAN 
indicator 7A) are not available for Ireland, 
France, the Netherlands and Sweden. The 
data on effective returns (FRAN indicator 7B) 
are not available for Ireland. In addition, the 
data of effective returns are not disaggre-
gated by return operation (voluntary and 
forced) for Spain. The data on voluntary ef-
