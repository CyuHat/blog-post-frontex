    Recent months have seen monumen-          
tal events and challenges that have af-       
fected the safety and wellbeing of all        
Europeans and will transform the en-          
tire picture of EU border and migration       
management for many years to come.            
From COVID-19 to the instrumentali-           
sation of migration, to the invasion of       
Ukraine, which has brought millions of        
refugees streaming across our borders –       
all these events have changed our lives,      
making crisis management a permanent          
feature of EU border management.              
    The shifting world is also highlighting   
the importance of trustworthy forecast-       
ing and strategic risk analysis for policy-   
makers and strategic planners at the EU       
and national levels. Reliable and proven      
analysis is invaluable to understanding       
these changes as they ripple through the           
many facets of European Integrated Bor-            
der Management (EIBM) – from migra-                
tion to cross-border crime to terrorist and        
hybrid threats.                                    
    For these reasons I am proud to pre-           
sent the Strategic Risk Analysis 2022              


prepared by the analysts at Frontex, the
European Border and Coast Guard Agency,
in cooperation with our many stakehold-
ers. This document provides strategic
foresight to identify threats, challenges
and opportunities in the field of EU bor-
der management and return over a 10-
year horizon. SRA 2022 focusses on six
megatrends that have the greatest im-
pact on the EIBM and its components,
and offers alternative future scenarios to
facilitate strategic conversations at both
EU and national levels.
   It is an ambitious exercise that aims
to provide long-term foresight and future
scenarios for effective policymaking, stra-
tegic decision-making and capability de-
velopment planning in a turbulent global
environment.

The unprecedented challenges for
EIBM also spotlight the role Frontex will
play over the coming years. The Agency
will continue to provide a comprehensive 
picture of what is happening at our exter-
nal borders and help Member States to se-
cure them, while protecting fundamental

rights that will be increasingly challenged
by the global trends. The reinforced Fron-
tex, with the strong operational back-
bone of the European Border and Coast
Guard Standing Corps, stands ready to an-
