5.2. Border checks: Clandestine entry

In 2018, Member States reported the
highest total in detections of clandestine
entry (people hiding in trains, lorries
and other vehicles seeking to enter the
EU at the external borders on both land
and sea routes) since 2015, testimony to
a persistency in migratory pressure, in
particular at certain border sections at
the EU’s external borders. At the same
time, falling detections at many border
sections in times of tightened border
surveillance at the green border – which
could increase the incentives for clandes-
tine entry – actually reveal differences in
procedures and data reporting among
Member States.
   At EU seaports, a lower number of
clandestine entry attempts reported by
Italy have led to a significant decrease
in the total (-35 %), whereas all other sea
borders reported fewer or roughly sim-

Please note that the number of effective returns may sometimes be larger than return decisions, as a return decision issued in a given month may be effectively enforced at a later date. Also, return decisions may be issued
without prejudice to the person’s right to apply for asylum. Readmissions between Member States are not included (for example between France and Italy). Effective returns do not necessarily mean returns to the country of
origin and, for example in the case of Syrians, they include returns of persons to third countries considered to be safe (for example from Hungary to Serbia).

also being currently used more system-
atically by some Member States, espe-
cially applied to third-country nationals
who have committed crimes or represent
a serious threat to public order. On the
side of forced returns, numerous Mem-

have increased the maximal detention
time prior to return operations, in order
to mitigate the risk of absconding, while
some are also planning to increase deten-

centres. Nevertheless, these measures
often seem to be insufficient.

* This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR 1244 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo* declaration of independence.

** Since January 2018, the breakdown for effective voluntary returns was changed from “IOM and Others” into “AVR, AVVR and Without assistance”.
    Because at the beggining of the year the old template was still used by some Member States, the breakdowns “IOM and Others” are still reported in 2018.
