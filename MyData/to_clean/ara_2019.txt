1. Preface
In 2018, the number of detections of illegal 
border-crossings reached its lowest level 
in five years, but migratory pressure re-
mained relatively high at the EUís exter-
nal borders. The total figure fell 27 % from 
the previous year to 150†114 and was 92 % be-
low the peak of the migratory crisis in 2015. 
This was in large part due to the dramatic 
fall in the number of migrants on the Cen-
tral Mediterranean route, where the num-
ber of detections plunged 80 % to 23†485.
Meanwhile, both the Western Med-
iterranean and the Eastern Mediter-
ranean routes saw an increase in the 
detections of illegal crossings last year. 
The Western Mediterranean became 
the most frequently used route into Eu-
rope. The pressure on Spain has been ris-
ing over the last years, and the number 
of detections in 2018 reached 57†034, dou-
ble the number from 2017. The number of 
departures from Morocco increased five-
fold. Most of the migrants taking this 
route last year came from sub-Saharan 
countries, but the number of Moroccan 
nationals also increased significantly.
The Eastern Mediterranean saw only 
slightly fewer detections than the West-
ern Mediterranean route. With 56†561 il-
legal border-crossings, the pressure was 
34 % higher than in the preceding year 
due to the increase in land crossings 
from Turkey to Greece.
Frontex, the European Border and 
Coast Guard Agency, maintains a strong 
presence at Europeís external borders. 
The Agency ran three permanent oper-
ations in Spain, Greece and Italy, as-
sisting EU Member States that faced the 
highest migratory pressure. On average, 
some 1†500 border guards are deployed 
in Frontex joint operations, along with 
vessels, planes, helicopters, patrol cars 
and other equipment. 
Last year, Frontex began to collect de-
tailed data on the sex and the age of ir-
regular migrants. Nearly one in five of all 
the detected migrants last year claimed 
to be under the age of 18. This new de-
velopment is crucial not only for a bet-
ter monitoring and understanding of the 
dynamics and composition of incoming 
migratory flows, but also for the effec-
tive identification of vulnerable groups. 
Checks at the external borders are one 
of the main safeguards of the Schengen 
Area. Frontex monitors Europeís borders 
24 hours a day, seven days a week, help-
ing the EU face challenges and threats 
at its borders, including threats related 
to cross-border crime and prevention of 
terrorism. The Agency is able to respond 
quickly and effectively to challenges at 
the external borders, shoulder-to-shoul-
der with EU Member States and Schen-
gen Associated Countries. This integrated 
approach, which brings together the ef-
forts of Frontex and other EU agencies, 
along with EU institutions and national 
authorities, is a key factor to address ir-
regular migration and cross-border crime 
at the external borders.
Despite the falling migratory pres-
sure in the Central Mediterranean, the 
fight against criminal smuggling net-
works at the external borders remains 
in our focus. In 2018, Frontex continued 
collecting information from voluntary

interviews with migrants in the Cen-
tral, Eastern and Western Mediterranean 
area in the framework of PeDRA (Pro-
cessing Personal Data for Risk Analysis). 
The vast majority (84 %) of the migrants 
interviewed claimed that they were fa-
cilitated by smuggling networks. Bor-
der guards are also the first filter at the 
external borders when it comes to the 
detection of potential terrorist threats. 
This is done through screening, registra-
tion, document checks or voluntary in-
terviews. We work closely with Europol 
and other European agencies sharing 
this information.
Over the last few years, the European 
Union and its Member States have been 
facing major challenges related to mi-
gration and security. As a response, a 
number of changes have been imple-
mented when it comes to border con-
trol and management. These include 
the amendment of the Schengen Bor-
ders Code, the establishment of the EU 
Entry / Exit System and the adoption of 
the regulation establishing the Euro-
pean Travel Information and Authori-
sation System (ETIAS). 
Frontex will play a central role in im-
plementing the regulation governing the 
ETIAS, a system for granting electronic 
pre-authorisation to travellers who do 
not need a visa to visit the Schengen 
area. The Agency will set up and man-
age the ETIAS Central Unit, which will 
provide operational support, as well as 
reinforcing and coordinating border con-
trol activities in Member States.
In 2018, the Agency substantially 
strengthened its activities aimed at 
returning irregular migrants to their 
countries of origin. Last year, we helped 
Member States return 13†729 people who 
do not have the right to remain in the EU 
to their countries of origin. We launched 
a successful trial of conducting returns 
on commercial flights to nearly 50 des-
tinations and we have significantly in-
creased our pre-return assistance to 
Member States.
To help Member States better prepare 
for potential challenges at their borders, 
for the second year Frontex conducted 
the vulnerability assessment to evalu-
ate the border control capabilities of EU 
member states. 
Last year, the Agency further devel-
oped its network of liaison officers to EU 
Member States. Those officers help Fron-
tex in the exchange of information with 
partners at national level, and contribute 
to the vulnerability assessment by col-
lecting relevant information and data.
The European Border and Coast Guard 
Agency is moving towards owning or 
leasing an increasingly larger portion 
of its equipment, including vehicles, 
planes and vessels, to be able to better 
support Member States. Last year, the 
Agency leased surveillance planes and 
tested the use of remote piloted aircraft 
systems in its operations.
The situation in the countries out-
side the EU also has a direct impact on 
Europeís borders. Frontex is monitoring 
the countries neighbouring the EU iden-
tified through risk analysis as countries 
of origin and / or transit for illegal immi-
gration. The aim is to better address chal-
lenges at EU borders. Frontex has become 
more active in countries neighbouring 
the EU that are affected by migration 
and cross-border crime, including the 
Western Balkans, where the EU signed 
an agreement on cooperation on bor-
der management between Albania and 
the European Border and Coast Guard 
Agency. The Agency also has three liai-
son officers outside the EU based in Tur-
key, Niger and Serbia.
Together with its partners, Frontex, 
the European Border and Coast Guard 
Agency, will continue to contribute to 
the safety and security at the EUís ex-
ternal borders and its citizens and to the 
well-functioning of the European Area of 
Freedom, Security and Justice.

2. Summary
Member States reported 150†114 illegal 
border-crossings in 2018, 27 % fewer than 
in 2017. The most decisive development 
for the overall level of migratory pressure 
in 2018 in fact dates back to July 2017, 
when the sudden reversal in the num-
ber of irregular migrants detected in the 
Central Mediterranean took place.  This 
reversal continues to stand as the most 
significant development at the EUís ex-
ternal borders since the implementation 
of the EU-Turkey statement. The decreas-
ing trend in migrant arrivals on the Cen-
tral Mediterranean route, which lasted 
throughout 2018, was the primary rea-
son for the decrease in the number of il-
legal border-crossings vis-‡-vis 2017. On 
this route, the other third countries of 
departure ñ Tunisia, Algeria and Turkey ñ 
equally had fewer successful departures. 
Egypt in 2018 did not see any departures 
of migrants to Europe on the sea route. 
With the number of illegal border-
crossings plummeting on the Central 
Mediterranean route, the spotlight 
moved onto the Western Mediterranean 
route, where in 2018 in particular Moroc-
can and sub-Saharan migrants crossed 
the Strait of Gibraltar or the Alboran Sea 
in record numbers, making the West-
ern Mediterranean route the most fre-
quently used route into Europe in 2018. 
Morocco was also the country of depar-
ture for a little more than half of the mi-
grants that targeted the Canary Islands 
on the Western African route. 
On the Eastern Mediterranean route, 
the most significant development of 2018 
was arguably the implementation of a re-
location and return programme in Tur-
key for irregular Syrian migrants, which 
shifted the nationality makeup on the 
Eastern Mediterranean Sea route in the 
second half of the year. 
The Western Balkan route in 2018 saw 
shifts between the Greek-Albanian cor-
ridor and the Serbian-centred corridor. 
Throughout the year, most of the migra-
tory pressure on the route materialised 
at the Bosnian and Herzegovinian-Croa-
tian border, and also, to a lesser extent, 
on Serbiaís border with Hungary, Croa-
tia and Romania.
At the Eastern Land Border in 2018, 
another third country, Russia, created 
with a temporary change in its visa pol-
icy an opportunity to reach the EUís ex-
ternal borders. For the 2018 FIFA World 
Cupô, Russia allowed travelers visa-free 
entry to the Russian Federation for those 
in possession of match tickets. This ena-
bled migrants to reach the EUís external 
borders via Russia, but also via Belarus 
and Ukraine, with migrants attempting 
to enter the EU illegally. This contrib-
uted to an increase in detections com-
pared with 2017, however remaining at 
much lower level than on other routes. 
Corresponding to the changes in the 
flows of the main migration routes, the 
migrant population in 2018 changed its 
nationality makeup ñ while Syrians 
remained the most common nationality 
due to the effects of the Turkish reloca-
tion and return programme only tak-
ing effect during the second half of the 
year, Moroccans were the second most 
common, before Afghans and Iraqis. 
Turkish nationals, as mentioned above, 
increased in number and were the fifth-
most common nationality in 2018.
In 2018, Member States reported an 
increase in the detection of clandestine 
entries. Nevertheless, the number of 
detected attempts of clandestine entry 
continued to be arguably below that to 
be expected in times of tightened bor-
der surveillance at the green and blue 
borders. 
Secondary movements continued on a 
large scale during 2018. Countries with-
out external land and sea borders re-
ported thousands of inland detections 
of illegal stay. These could however be 
overstays after having entered via the 
air borders. Yet Eurodac hits of both cate-
gories, combined having registered a to-
tal higher than illegal border-crossings 
in 2018, are evidence of the scale of sec-
ondary movements. In this context, the 
increase in the inland detection of peo-
ple smugglers (+13 %) is also an indica-
tion of the reliance on organised crime 
networks to smuggle migrants to their 
countries of destination. In addition, a 
significant increase in document fraud 
detections on secondary movements was 
recorded in 2018. In fact, the number of

document fraud detections on second-
ary movements inside the EU/Schengen 
area reached its highest level since 2013.
The year 2018 once again signified a 
year of heavy workload for border guards 
in Member States, who were faced with 
another increase in entry and exit checks 
to be performed at border crossing points 
with a further rise in passenger flows 
and the 2017 expansion of systematic 
checks on those passengers enjoying the 
right of free movement under EU law. 
This meant at times delays for passen-
gers at certain border-crossing points. 
The second line, too, was in many Mem-
ber States kept busy by for instance an 
increase in refusals of entry along the 
external borders, but also by the afore-
mentioned increase in document fraud 
detections on secondary movements. In 
particular, at the borders with Ukraine, 
the increase in issued refusals of entry to 
Ukrainians was significant. The catego-
ries of refusals reported imply that visa 
liberalisation wrongly suggests to trav-
ellers that they no longer need to justify 
the purpose and conditions of stay and 
present sufficient means of subsistence 
on request. As regards exit checks, ille-
gal stay detections on exit at air, land 
and sea borders increased slightly. This 
too then meant an increase in workload 
in particular for the second line of bor-
der checks.
The number of effective returns in 
2018 once again fell short of the decisions 
issued by Member States to return mi-
grants: Around 148†000 migrants who 
were not granted asylum or subsidiary 
protection were returned to their coun-
tries of origin, little more than half the 
total number of return decisions issued. 
In particular, no measurable progress 
was made as regards returns to West Af-
rica ñ while the number of return deci-
sions issued increased by roughly 80 % 
compared with 2017, effective returns 
remained unchanged, reflecting defi-
cits in cooperation and administrative 
capacity in countries of origin. 
Looking ahead, there is no indi-
cation that the workload for border 
guards will decrease anytime soon, 
with systematic checks in an environ-
ment of increasing passenger flows 
on the one hand and persistent mi-
gratory pressure on the green and 
blue borders on the other. Eu-
ropean border management 
will continue to be tested by 
unforeseeable events and 
factors ñ beyond irregular 
migration and into cross-
border crime.

3. Introduction
The Frontex Risk Analysis for 2019 has 
been specifically designed to provide an 
overview to help in making informed 
decisions on both common European 
investments and concerted actions to 
improve the management of external 
borders and uphold the internal secu-
rity of the Union.
Frontex operational activities aim at 
strengthening border security by sup-
porting Member Statesí actions regard-
ing the implementation of EU measures 
for the management of external borders. 
The coordination of operational activi-
ties contributes to a more efficient allo-
cation of Member Statesí resources and 
better protection of the area of freedom, 
security and justice. In this context, the 
Risk Analysis for 2019 concentrates on 
the scope of Frontex operational activi-
ties and, in particular, on irregular mi-
gration at the external borders of the EU 
and the Schengen Associated Countries.
Since the Regulation (EU) 2016 / 1624 
came into effect, the mandate of Frontex 
has significantly been enhanced to en-
sure an efficient implementation of Eu-
ropean Integrated Border Management 
as a shared responsibility of the Union, 
the Agency and of the national author-
ities of the Member States.
The European Integrated Border Man-
agement consists of 11 strategic compo-
nents defined in Article 4 of the Agencyís 
Regulation. These are: border control, 
including measures in relation to traf-
ficking in human beings and terrorism, 
search and rescue operations, analysis 
of risks for internal security, coopera-
tion with Member States, inter-agency 
cooperation, cooperation with third coun-
tries, measures within the Schengen area 
related to border control, return of third-
country nationals, use of state-of-the-art 
technology, quality control mechanisms 
and solidarity mechanisms. These com-
ponents, together with the three hori-
zontal components ñ fundamental rights, 
training, research and innovation, col-
lectively form the main elements of the 
technical and operational strategy for Eu-
ropean Integrated Border Management.
Clearly, this major change has im-
portant implications for the analytical 
work performed by Frontex as its risk 
analysis should cover all aspects of Inte-
grated Border Management and develop 
an early warning mechanism. Therefore, 
as much as possible, these new elements 
have been integrated into this annual 
risk analysis. 
This annual report is structured as 
follows: (1) situational picture for the 
European Border and Coast Guard with 
emphasis on identified migratory trends 
and surveillance activities utilising a set 
of reliable indicators on irregular migra-
tion; (2) featured analyses on key risks 
affecting the security of the external bor-
ders and / or internal security; and finally 
(3) a presentation of outlook.
The Agency and in particular its Risk 
Analysis Unit would like to express its 
gratitude to all members of FRAN in 
Member States and third country part-
ners for their efforts in providing data 
and information, as well as EASO, 
 Europol, the EU Agency for Fundamen-
tal Rights, and all colleagues involved in 
the preparation of this report.

4. Methodology
A coherent and comprehensive analy-
sis of the risks affecting security at the 
external borders requires, above all, the 
adoption of common indicators. Consist-
ent monitoring of these indicators al-
lows effective measures to be taken on 
the ground. The analysis needs to iden-
tify the risks that arise at the external 
borders themselves and those that arise 
in third countries.
The backbone of the Risk Analysis for 
2019 is the monthly statistics exchanged 
among Member States within the frame-
work of the FRAN. For the Risk Analy-
sis for†2019, the key indicators collected 
through the FRAN were: detections of 
illegal border-crossing at the  green and 
blue border or at BCPs; refusals of en-
try; detections of illegal stay; detections 
of facilitators; detections of fraudulent 
documents; return decisions; effective 
returns and passenger flow data (when 
available). Data on asylum applica-
tions for 2018 were still being collected 
within the FRAN, but Frontex increas-
ingly works with data collected by EASO, 
which has provided the dedicated sec-
tion on asylum.
The data were categorised by border 
type (land, air or sea) and those on land 
borders were additionally grouped by 
border section with neighbouring third 
countries. The data exchanged within 
the FRAN are compiled and analysed on 
a quarterly basis. Priority is given to the 
use of the data for management purposes 
and to their fast sharing among Member 
State border-control authorities.
Member Statesí data processed by 
Frontex are not treated as official statis-
tics and thus may occasionally vary from 
those officially published by national au-
thorities. Throughout 2018, some FRAN 
members performed backdated updates 
of their 2017 statistics. These updates 
have been accounted for in this docu-
ment, hence some data presented here 
may differ from those presented a year 
ago in the Risk Analysis for 2018. 
Member States were not requested to 
answer specific questions in support of 
this analysis. Rather, bimonthly analyt-
ical reports and incident reports of Mem-
ber States routinely collected within the 
FRAN, as well as other Member Statesí 
contributions submitted in 2018 were im-
portant sources of  information,  especially 
12 of 52
Frontex ∑ Risk Analysis for 2019
as regards the analysis of routes and modi 
operandi. Additionally, the outcomes of 
debriefing activities carried out in the 
framework of Joint Operations consti-
tuted essential analytical material.
Open-source information was also ef-
fectively exploited, especially in identify-
ing the main ëpush and pull factorsí for 
irregular migration to the EU. Among 
others, these sources included reports 
issued by government agencies, inter-
national and non-governmental organ-
isations, as well as mainstream news 
agencies and official EU reports.
External borders, a term often used 
in this report, refer to the borders be-
tween Member States and third coun-
tries. The borders between the Schengen 
Associated Countries (Norway, Iceland, 
and Switzerland) and third countries are 
also considered as external borders. By 
contrast, the borders between the Schen-
gen Associated Countries and Schengen 
Member States are considered as internal 
borders. For the indicators on detections 
of facilitators, illegal stay and asylum, 
statistics are also reported for detections 
at the land borders between Schengen 
Member States and those Member States 
that have either not joined the Schen-
gen area yet in full (Bulgaria, Croatia, 
Cyprus, Romania) or have opted to stay 
out of it (the UK, Ireland). Thus, a total 
for Member States and Schengen Asso-
ciated Countries as a whole can be pre-
sented. It was not possible to make the 
aforementioned distinction for air and 
sea borders because Member States do 
not habitually differentiate between ex-
tra-EU and intra-EU air and sea connec-
tions but tend to aggregate data for all 
arrivals per airport. 
Consistent with other law-enforce-
ment indicators, variation in admin-
istrative data related to border control 
depends on several factors. In this case, 
the number of detections of illegal bor-
der-crossing and refusals of entry are 
both functions of the amount of effort 
spent, respectively, on detecting mi-
grants and the actual flow of irregular 
migrants to the EU. For example, in-
creased detections of illegal border-cross-
ing might be due to a real increase in the 
flow of irregular migrants, or may in fact 
be an outcome of more resources made 
available to detect them. In exceptional 
cases, increased resources may produce 
a rise in reported detections while effec-
tively masking the actual decrease in the 
migratory flow, resulting from a strong 
deterrent effect.

Please note that selection of these border sections does not

For the third year in a row following 
Europeís migration crisis of 2015, the 
number of detections of illegal border-
crossing along the EUís external bor-
ders fell significantly. In 2018, Member 
States reported 150†114 detections of il-
legal border-crossing along the EUís ex-
ternal borders, which represents a 27 % 
decrease compared with 2017 (around a 
twelfth of the 1.8 million detections at 
the height of the migration crisis). The 
decrease in 2018 was almost exclusively 
due to fewer detections on the Central 
Mediterranean route. The continuously 
mounting migratory pressure on the 
Western Mediterranean route and the 
once again rising pressure on the East-
ern Mediterranean route caution ñ inter 
alia indications attesting to the persistent 
migratory pressure ñ against overempha-
sising the fact that the total number of 
detections stands at its lowest level since 
2013. Thanks to enhanced data collection, 
the share of women in the overall irreg-
ular migrant population can be more ac-
curately determined at 18 %. Nearly one 
in five of the detected migrants claimed 
to be under the age of 18.
Central Mediterranean route
On the Central Mediterranean route, 
departures from all third countries 
dropped in 2018. Noteworthy, Tunisia 
replaced Libya as the main country of 
departure for migrants detected on the 
Central Mediterranean route in Septem-
ber, October and December (in the other 
months it was Libya). Importantly, de-
partures from Libya, having fallen by 
87 %, accounted for the vast majority of 
the drop in detected migrants on this 
route. Departures from Algeria fell by al-
most half compared with 2017, while de-
partures from Turkey via the Aeagan and 
Ionian Sea fell by 37 %. The route hence re-
corded its lowest number of intercepted 
migrants since 2012. The share of claimed 
minors on this route increased slightly 
in 2018 compared with 2017, recording a 
share of 19 % (84 % of them unaccompa-
nied). Tunisians and Eritreans were the 
two most represented nationalities on 
this route, together accounting for more 
than one third of all detected migrants.
Western Mediterranean route
After more than doubling between 2016 
and 2017, detections on the Western Med-
iterranean route once again more than 
doubled between 2017 and 2018, to 57†034 
detections, thus making this route the

Figure 1. Detections of illegal border-crossing, by main nationalities  
(scale in absolute numbers, with labels showing percentages of total) in 2018 
most frequently used route into Europe 
in 2018. Hence, Morocco was the main 
departure point to Europe for irregular 
migrants. The majority of the increase 
stems from departures from Morocco, 
which more than doubled. Most of the 
migratory pressure registered on this 
route was linked to migrants originating 
from sub-Saharan countries; however, 
towards the end of 2018, the number of 
Moroccan migrants began to increase. 
On this route, those that claimed to be 
minors accounted for a 9 % share of ar-
rivals in 2018. Overall, on both land and 
sea routes, Moroccans were the top de-
tected nationality, followed by Guine-
ans, Malians and Algerians.
Eastern Mediterranean route
With only slightly fewer detections than 
on the Western Mediterranean route, 
the Eastern Mediterranean route regis-
tered 56†561 illegal border-crossings in 
2018. Because of Turkish preventions of 
departure, the number of detections in 
the Eastern Aegean Sea was roughly un-
changed. The implementation of a relo-
cation and return programme in Turkey 
for irregular Syrian migrants slightly 
shifted the nationality makeup on the 
Eastern Mediterranean route in the sec-
ond half of 2018 with smuggling net-
works increasingly offering Afghans the 
possibility of reaching the Greek Eastern 
Aegean islands, thereby offsetting the 
lower number of Syrian migrants. Never-
theless, Syrians were still the most com-
monly detected nationality. The number 
of recorded Turkish migrants more than 
tripled in 2018 with 7†918 arrivals thereby 
becoming the fourth most common na-
tionality on this route behind the afore-
mentioned nationalities and Iraqis.
Western Balkan route
The Western Balkans continued to be 
transited by irregular migrants trying to 
reach Western Europe from Turkey. Two 
main routes through the region stood 
out in 2018 with pressure shifting be-
tween them as border control activities 
were enhanced and reinforced in certain 
areas. Both, the central route via Serbia 
and the route stemming from the Greek-
Albanian border section projected pres-
sure northwards, along the Bosnian and 
HerzegovinianñCroatianñSlovenian cor-
ridor and to a lesser extent on Serbiaís 
EU borders with Hungary, Croatia and 
Romania. The top nationalities detected 
transiting the region were largely simi-
lar to those reported on the Eastern Med-
iterranean route, with the exception of 
Iranians who reached the Balkans via 
Serbia having mostly abused visa-free 
access to Serbia, which was rescinded 
in October.
Western African route
On the Western African route, a strong 
increase in detected irregular migrants 
was registered (+264 % to around 1†500), 
mostly in the second part of the year and 
mostly Moroccans who had the Canary 
Islands as their final intended destina-
tion, oftentimes with family links on the 
Islands. A little more than half of these 
migrants departed from Morocco while 
the rest mostly departed from Senegal.
Eastern Land Border route
The Eastern land border in 2018 saw an 
approximately 24 % increase in detec-
tions compared with 2017, partly due 
to migrants abusing the FIFA Fan ID, 
which allowed travelers visa-free entry 
to Russia, from where, coming also via 
Belarus and Ukraine, the migrants at-
tempted to enter the EU illegally. With 
a share of around 34 %, Vietnamese na-
tionals represented an even larger por-
tion of illegal border-crossings at the 
Eastern Land Border route compared to 
2017, followed at a distance by Iraqis, 
Russians and Ukrainians.

5.2. Border checks: Clandestine entry
In 2018, Member States reported the 
highest total in detections of clandestine 
entry (people hiding in trains, lorries 
and other vehicles seeking to enter the 
EU at the external borders on both land 
and sea routes) since 2015, testimony to 
a persistency in migratory pressure, in 
particular at certain border sections at 
the EUís external borders. At the same 
time, falling detections at many border 
sections in times of tightened border 
surveillance at the green border ñ which 
could increase the incentives for clandes-
tine entry ñ actually reveal differences in 
procedures and data reporting among 
Member States. 
At EU seaports, a lower number of 
clandestine entry attempts reported by 
Italy have led to a significant decrease 
in the total (-35 %), whereas all other sea 
borders reported fewer or roughly sim-
ilar numbers. As regards Italian ports, 
the nationalities of persons attempting 
to enter clandestinely reflected both di-
verse port connections southwards (Tu-
nisians and Moroccans) and eastwards 
(Iraqis and Turks).

5.3. Border checks: Refusals of entry
In 2018, 190 930 refusals of entry were 
reported along the external borders of 
the EU, a slight increase compared with 
2017. While the increases were at the air 
and land borders, refusals issued at sea 
borders decreased by 41 %. 
More than half of the refusals con-
tinued to be issued to three nationali-
ties ñ Ukrainian, Russian and Albanian. 
Refusals issued to Ukrainians increased 
by almost 60 %, whereas Russians (by 
roughly one-third, meanwhile the 
number of Russians at the EUís borders 
without a valid visa or residence permit 
decreased) and Albanians (by roughly 
one-fourth) recorded strong decreases.
Refusals of entry issued to Ukraini-
ans have been steadily increasing since 
2014, but the increase from 2017 to 2018 
was more pronounced than in the pre-
vious year. Unsurprisingly, nine out of 
ten refusals were issued at the EU bor-
ders with Ukraine. The increase was in 
particular due to increases in refusals is-
sued because of a lack of appropriate doc-
umentation justifying the purpose and 
conditions of stay and the inability to 
present sufficient means of subsistence. 
The increases in both categories of rea-
sons for refusals was most likely linked 
to visa liberalisation, which started in 
June 2017, oftentimes meaning that the 
visitors were unaware of the existing re-
quirements to be fulfilled to enter the 
Schengen zone. 
At sea borders, a decrease in refusals 
of persons for whom an alert had been 
issued in the Schengen Information Sys-
tem or in a national register is notable. 
Italian seaports reported much of the de-
crease with refusals being issued to pas-
sengers coming from Albania. 
At air borders, there was little change 
in the airports that issued most refus-
als of entry.

5.4. Border checks: Fraudulent documents
In 2018, Member States reported 6†667 in-
dividuals from third countries present-
ing fraudulent travel documents at BCPs 
on entry to the EU/SAC. The number of 
detections continues to follow its de-
creasing trend started in 2014, when ex-
ceptionally high numbers were reported 
on account of the Syrian diaspora. In 
contrast, the number of document fraud 
detections on secondary movements in-
side the EU/Schengen area increased in 
2018 for the second year in a row. The fig-
ure increased by almost 42 % compared 
with 2017 and reached its highest level 
since 2013. Following a trend already ob-
served during 2017, this development was 
mainly caused by the significant increase 
in departures from Greece involving Syr-
ian, Afghan, Iraqi, Iranian and Turkish 
nationals. Of these nationalities, Turks 
recorded the most marked increase com-
pared with 2017.
At EU level, of the 135 nationalities 
detected using fraudulent documents to 
illegally enter the EU/SAC from a third 
country, the most commonly detected 
as in the previous year were Moroccan 
(977), followed by Iranian (450), Ukrain-
ian (401) and Turkish (394). The number 
of Ukrainian fraudulent document users 
decreased dramatically from 785 in 2017.
The remarkable progress recorded 
in the case of Ukrainian nationals was 
mostly brought about by visa liberalisa-
tion for the rightful holders of Ukrain-
ian biometric passports, which entered 
into force in June 2017. The same goes for 
Georgian nationals due to visa liberali-
sation in March 2017. Apart from Turks, 
the number of Nigerians and Chinese de-
tected with fraudulent documents cross-
ing the external EU borders recorded a 
slight increase. After the relatively high 
number of Iranians detected on exit from 
Serbia, the trend has become stable dur-
ing 2018 until the decision of the Serbian 
authorities to revoke visa-free travel for 
Iranians in October 2018. Serbiaís deci-
sion to rescind visa-free travel for Ira-
nians will probably result in a further 
decrease in the number of arrivals of 
Iranian fraudulent document users at 
the South-East EU border with Serbia 
in 2019. 
In 2018, the top five most reported 
nationalities detected with fraudulent 
documents on entry to the EU/Schen-
gen area from third countries remain al-
most the same as in the 2017 apart from 
Turks, who have replaced Albanians (due 
to their lower number) amongst the top 
five. The anticipated increase during and 
immediately after the 2018 FIFA World 
Cupô did not materialise and figures 
have been not particularly affected, apart 
from a few cases registered mainly in 
the Baltic republics on entry from Rus-
sia and Belarus. 
Istanbulís Atat¸rk Airport remains the 
top departure airport for detections 
of fraudulent documents from third 
countries despite a sharp decrease in 
numbers
As in previous years, most detections 
of fraudulent documents were reported 
on air routes. With 335 detections, the

30 % in 2018 compared with 2017. Both 
Atat¸rk and Sabiha GˆkÁen (Istanbul) 
airports reported the lowest number of 
document fraud cases since 2013. 
The second ñ most reported last air-
port of departure in 2018 was Moham-
med IV airport in Casablanca with 211 
detected persons using fraudulent doc-
uments in their attempt to cross the ex-
ternal EU borders. 
At the land borders most of the 
detections of document fraud 
continued to be inbound from Ukraine 
and Serbia but to Hungary, instead of 
Poland, as the primary destination
Whilst in 2017 most of the document 
fraud cases at the land borders were re-
ported between Ukraine and Poland, dur-
ing 2018 the border between Hungary 
and Serbia saw the brunt of cases. The 
visa liberalisation regime for Ukrainian 
nationals that entered into force in June 
2017, however, already led to a decrease 
in the number of Ukrainians abusing 
fraudulently obtained visas in the lat-
ter part of that year. 
At the external sea borders, no signif-
icant change was observed in compari-
son with previous years. 
Abuse of fraudulent documents for 
secondary movements is more and 
more in the spotlight
While detections of fraudulent docu-
ment users inbound from third coun-
tries were stable, the same cannot be 
said about fake document users on sec-
ondary movements. The sustained in-
crease in demand from within the EU 
for fraudulent documents has prompted 
established counterfeiters to increase 
their production and to establish new 
print shops.
The number of irregular migrants 
stuck in a nation different from their 
final destination increased in frontier 
Mediterranean states like Greece, Italy 
and Spain. As a consequence, these mi-
grants explore any possible option to 
move further towards their final des-
tination, even purchasing fraudulent 
travel documents.

5.5. Situation of asylum in the EU by EASO
Until the end of December 2018, some 
634†000 applications for international 
protection were lodged in the 28 EU 
Member States plus Norway and Swit-
zerland (EU+), about 10 % fewer than in 
2017.1 At least one in 10 applicants in 
2018 had previously lodged an applica-
tion in the same EU+ reporting country 
(repeated applicants).
After the peak in asylum applica-
tions in the second half of 2015 and the 
high level sustained in 2016, the num-
ber of asylum claims began to decrease, 
and has remained relatively stable ever 
since (Fig. 4). In 2018, the number of 
1 EASO Early warning and Preparedness 
System (EPS) data are shared between 
EASO and the EU+ countries. They 
are provisional, unvalidated data and 
therefore might differ from validated 
data submitted at a later date to 
Eurostat (according to Regulation (EC) 
No†862/2007). The data included here are 
the latest as of 24 January 2019. 
applications fluctuated between some 
47† 000 and 57† 000, except for Octo-
ber when it went up to some 61†700. 
Throughout 2018, detections of illegal 
border-crossing continued to be at a con-
sistently lower level than asylum appli-
cations, similar to the pattern in 2017 as 
well as prior to the migration crisis. This 
difference is probably related to multi-
ple factors, including applications by 
persons crossing external borders unde-
tected, repeated applicants in the same 
reporting country, secondary movements 
across the EU+, and applications by na-
tionalities who entered the EU+ legally. 
The latter category includes arrivals with 
genuine visa, and also those from coun-
tries exempt from a Schengen visa which 
in 2018 represented 18 % of all asylum ap-
plications (Fig. 5).
The main countries of origin of appli-
cants for international protection in the 
EU+ were Syria (74†680 applications), Af-
ghanistan (45†273), Iraq (42†042), Pakistan 
(28†797), and Iran (25†397), jointly repre-
senting about a third of all applicants 
(Fig. 5). All of these countries, except for 
Iran, were also in the top five in 2017. In 
addition to Iran, there were considera-
ble increases in the number of applicants 
from Venezuela and Turkey. Similar to 
2017, the population of applicants re-
mained diverse with citizens of about 
60 countries lodging over 1†000 appli-
cations in the EU+. There was a notable 
increase in the share of applicants from 
Schengen-visa exempt countries, from 
13†% in 2017 to 18†% in 2018. The rise was 
most notable for citizens of Venezuela, 
Georgia and Colombia.
In 2018, over 67†000 applications were 
withdrawn in the EU+, about four fifths 
of them implicitly which is when an ap-
plicant is no longer present and thought 
to have absconded. The citizenships of 
applicants with most withdrawn appli-
cations were Iraqi, Pakistani, Afghan, 
Nigerian, and Syrian.

In 2018, over 590†500 decisions were 
issued at first instance, a decrease by two 
fifths compared to 2017. As in previous 
years, fewer decisions were issued over 
the summer months (Fig. 6). The share 
of positive decisions i.e. those grant-
ing either refugee status or subsidiary 
protection was 34 %, declining for a sec-
ond year. As earlier, this recognition 
rate differed substantially across na-
tionalities. Among the applicants with 
more than 10†000 issued decisions, Syr-
ians (87 %) and Eritreans (82 %) continued 
to have the highest recognition rate. 
Conversely, the lowest rates in this group 
were for applicants from Georgia (3 %), 
The Gambia (4 %), and Bangladesh (5 %).
At the end of December 2018, about 
440†000 cases were pending at first in-
stance in the EU+ countries.

5.6. Illegal stayers and arrested people smugglers
Illegal stayers
In 2018, Member States reported a sig-
nificantly reduced number of detections 
of illegal stay, entirely due to a decrease 
in inland detections. Detections on exit 
at air, land and sea borders on the other 
hand increased slightly.
Illegal stay detections inland fell by 
23 % compared with 2017, which is un-
surprising considering its inherent link 
to the overall number of irregular mi-
grants arriving on EU territory. A look 
at the Member States reporting the most 
detections ñ as well as at the national-
ities ñ confirms the continuing link to 
the strong increases in irregular migra-
tory movements on the Western and 
to a lesser extent on the Eastern Med-
iterranean routes. Among the general 
trend of falling detections, unsurpris-
ingly Greece and Spain buck this trend. 
So too does Portugal, which however is 
not altogether related to the traditional 
migration routes but rather is the result 
of migrants having arrived on air routes 
from Latin America. Brazilians were by 
far the largest group detected, with de-
tections more than doubling compared 
with 2017.
As regards illegal stay on exit, totals 
on land, air and sea borders all increased 
moderately. Looking at the nationalities 
concerned, Ukrainians were the most 
commonly detected by a distance, re-
cording an almost linear increase since 
data collection on this indicator began, 
mostly attributable to exit checks at the 
Polish and Hungarian land borders. Il-
legal stay on exit at air borders saw few 
changes ñ however, the number of Al-
banians detected for illegal stay on exit 
at airports, who in 2017 were the most 
common nationality detected, fell by 
half compared with 2017.  
People smugglers
Member States reported 10†642 detected 
people smugglers in 2018, only slightly 
more than in 2017. The Member States 
that are reporting the most detected peo-
ple smugglers equally have not changed 
in order. Considering the nationalities 
of the people smugglers involved, while 
there are some increases and decreases, 
it is more or less the same mix of na-
tionalities from transit countries, coun-
tries of entry, countries heavily affected 
by secondary movements, and finally 
countries associated with well-known 
organised crime groups. Increases in de-
tections associated with migratory pres-
sure from the Western Balkan route and 
secondary movements thereafter are no-
table in Croatia and Slovenia. At the sea 
borders, a disproportionate decrease in 
detections beyond the overall decrease 
in illegal border-crossings on sea routes 
suggests that smuggling groups have 
further excelled in successfully operat-
ing out of the reach of Member Statesí 
law enforcement.

5.7. In the EU: Returns
In 2018, Member States reported around 
287†000 return decisions issued to third-
country nationals, which is around 2 % 
more than in 2017. The absolute total 
number of migrants subject to return 
decisions might still be higher, as data 
on decisions were unavailable from Aus-
tria, France and the Netherlands. Ger-
many and the UK also do not report all 
data on return decisions to the FRAN.
As in previous years, the number of 
return decisions was much larger than 
the total number of effective returns to 
third countries, which decreased by 5 % 
to around 148†000 in 2018. Between 2012 
and 2015, this indicator has remained 
rather unaffected by peaks in irregular 
migration, varying between a level of 
150†000 and 175†000 effective returns. 
The main reasons for non-return are re-
lated to practical problems in the iden-
tification of returnees and in obtaining 
the necessary documentation from third 
country authorities. In addition, many 
decisions to return voluntarily do not 
materialise as the persons decide to ab-
scond and stay illegally. 
In relation to most Member States, 
both return indicators correlated and 
showed a similar annual downward or 
upward trend. A decline in the number 
of issued return decisions and conducted 
effective returns in 2018 was particu-
larly visible in those Member States that 
were most affected by the migration peak 
of 2015/2016, e.g. Germany, Sweden or 
Hungary. On the other hand, countries 
that played a larger role as transit or 
destination countries in 2018 reported 
higher figures in relation to the return 
indicators, e.g. Spain and France. 
In general, within the number of ef-
fective returns to third countries, around 
50 % were reported to be on a voluntary 
basis and 50 % were forced returns.
A breakdown by third-country na-
tionalities reveals clearly diverging de-
velopments. The nationalities with the 
largest increase in effective returns com-
pared to 2017 were Ukrainian and Geor-
gian nationals, who have in common 
that their Schengen visa obligation was 
waived in 2017. Frontex-supported opera-
tions have contributed to this increase: in 
2018, 1†114†Georgians and 114 Ukrainians 
were returned in the framework of Fron-
tex-supported operations. Current Fron-
tex data do not only show an increase in 
cases of abuse of the new visa policy by 
these two nationalities, but also a level of 
cooperation with the Ukrainian and Geor-
gian authorities that allows the return of 
an increasing number of their citizens.
Albanians are the nationality with 
the largest absolute decrease in effective 
returns compared to 2017 (-25 % to fewer 
than 20†000). Similar to other Western 
Balkan nationalities, this was in line 
with a general decline in the irregular 
migration pressure of Albanian nation-
als, reflected by a lower number of asy-
lum applications, illegal stays, illegal 
border crossings, refusals of entry, and 
issued return decisions. 
In contrast, the number of effective 
returns of Afghan nationals decreased 
by 32 % in 2018 in spite of a 67 % increase 
in illegal border-crossings compared to 
2017. The reason for these converse trends 
is that the number of irregularly arriving 
Afghans started to rise only by the second 
half of 2018, and that the national asy-
lum authorities have not yet concluded 
the related asylum procedures.
Please note that the number of effective returns may sometimes be larger than return decisions, as a return decision issued in a given month may be effectively enforced at a later date. Also, return decisions may be issued 
without prejudice to the personís right to apply for asylum. Readmissions between Member States are not included (for example between France and Italy). Effective returns do not necessarily mean returns to the country of 
origin and, for example in the case of Syrians, they include returns of persons to third countries considered to be safe (for example from Hungary to Serbia).

6.  Featured analyses
6.1. Interviews of migrants
In 2018, Frontex continued collecting 
information from voluntary interviews 
with newly arrived migrants in the Cen-
tral, Eastern and Western Mediterra-
nean area in the framework of PeDRA 
(Processing Personal Data for Risk Anal-
ysis). Migrants coming from more than 
60 countries were interviewed upon their 
arrival in Italy, Greece and Spain. 
As regards the nationalities inter-
viewed Iraqis, Syrians, Algerians, Tu-
nisians and Afghans featured among the 
top five, followed by Moroccans, Guine-
ans, Pakistanis, Ivorians and Eritreans. 
Most of the interviewed migrants be-
longed to the age group 18ñ35 years old 
(82 %) and were unmarried (65 %) males 
(89 %) from the Middle Eastern, African, 
and Asian countries ñ together account-
ing for 60 % of interviews. 
In 2018, a significant number (77 %) of 
the interviewed migrants stated a pref-
erence regarding their final destina-
tion countries. Based on their answers, 
France was the most common final des-
tination country, followed by Spain, Ger-
many, Italy, and Greece. In 2017, Italy, 
France, Germany, Spain, Greece and 
United Kingdom were at the top of the 
list. This reoccurring trend suggests that 
migrants prefer a few final destination 
countries. This represents a stable trend 
observed at least over the last three years. 
The vast majority (84 %) of the mi-
grants interviewed in 2018 claimed that 
they had been smuggled and only 7 % 
declared that they had arrived in a Eu-
ropean country without using a people 
smuggler. About 9 % did not reply to this 
question. This high number shows the 
massive role played by people smuggling 
networks. In terms of the smugglersí na-
tionalities, the top ranking nationalities 
were Syrian, Afghan, Iraqi, Libyan and 
Moroccan followed by suspects from Tur-
key, Tunisia, Algeria, Guinea and Iran.
Regarding smuggling networks the 
three main observations are:
 <U+25AA> Migrants turn to their fellow na-
tionals to be smuggled into the EU. 
These persons usually play the role 
as recruiters.
 <U+25AA> The people smugglers are not only 
based or operate in the country of de-
parture but operate mainly in third 
countries bordering the EU (Turkey, 
Libya, Morocco, etc.)
 <U+25AA> The people smuggling networks are 
well established and have been ac-
tive for many years. Although the 
leading figures are often nationals 
of the last country of departure the 
associates of the smugglers are from 
different countries.
Where are the people smugglers 
from and where are they based?
Even though some of the interviewees 
claimed that the people who smuggled 
them were based in their country of or-
igin, arranging the whole journey, the 
vast majority of the interviewed mi-
grants claimed that the people smug-
glers were based in the last country of 
departure (71 %). This does not necessar-
ily exclude the possibility that networks 
organised the whole facilitation from 
beginning to end, although it strongly 
indicates that the presence of people 
smuggling networks is predominant at 
the last point of departure.
Interviews found that Somali mi-
grants were mainly smuggled by Somali 
suspects and to a lesser extent by Libyans 
and Eritreans. The same pattern appears 
for all the other groups of migrants. They 
are primarily in contact with fellow na-
tionals or individuals from their neigh-
bouring countries who cooperated with 
smuggling networks. 
In 2018, Iraqi and Syrian migrants 
headed mainly to Izmir and were smug-
gled by criminal networks involving pri-
marily Syrian and Iraqi suspects and to 
a lesser extent Turkish suspects. Simi-
larly, migrants from Afghanistan and 
Pakistan showed the same pattern of be-
haviour, being smuggled via Istanbul by 
fellow Afghan and Pakistani. 
It appears that the journey of mi-
grants who can afford to spend more 
money to get into Europe are planned 
in advance, before their departure. For 
example, the majority of the migrants 
who reached Italy by sailing boats from 
Turkey, spending around EUR 5†000 per 
person, claimed that they had access to 
the smuggling networks before their de-
parture and agreed on the route, method 
and the amount of money before they 
started their journey. 
The people smugglers offering full-
package migration function almost 
similar to a travel agent and they are 
multinational as well. They maintain re-
cruiting agents/contacts in the country 
of origin who possess the same nation-
ality or are from the same country as the 
migrants. The interviews suggest that in 
2018, there were criminal networks ac-
tive in Turkey who were in a position to 
offer these services, entailing complex 
28 of 52
Frontex ∑ Risk Analysis for 2019
coordination and financial capital to pro-
cure accommodation, flight tickets and 
transport by sailing boats. 
Information from interviews suggests 
that members of migrant smuggling net-
works typically work with a number of 
lower-level contacts who are part of their 
personal network. Based on Frontex in-
terviews, it is quite evident that many 
migrants, after one or more unsuccess-
ful attempts to cross the border easily 
find a different network. This shows the 
high availability and flexibility of crim-
inal networks offering their services.
Regarding the methods of operating 
and recruiting, the smugglers make use 
of social media, predominantly Face-
book, to advertise their services. Some 
are openly advertising smuggling ser-
vices, while there are closed groups that 
are only accessible through trusted part-
ners and associates.

6.2. Children in migration: overview of 
arrivals at the external borders in 2018
In January 2018, Frontex considerably en-
larged the scope of its data collection by 
starting to collect migration data disag-
gregated by age and sex from the Mem-
ber States via the Frontex Risk Analysis 
Network (FRAN). This new development 
ensures better monitoring and greater 
understanding of the dynamics and com-
position of migratory flows. It also marks 
an important step for EU border manage-
ment by allowing the Agency to compile 
more comprehensive and tailored risk 
assessments, effectively identify vul-
nerable groups and and target its oper-
ational responses.1 
As regards children, the newly col-
lected data (which includes, besides age 
and sex, if children are accompanied or 
unaccompanied) is instrumental in de-
termining vulnerabilities, as well as sex 
and age-specific protection needs. This 
knowledge is enabling Frontex and Mem-
ber States to tailor their border manage-
ment activities accordingly, for example 
by deploying technical equipment, form-
ing migration management support 
teams comprised of different profiles 
(i.e. female officers, child protection ex-
perts, cultural mediators and interpret-
ers), and providing specific child-related 
1 People below the age of 18.
training (i.e. covering child appropriate 
communication insert: or training on 
how to identify potential child victims 
of trafficking in human beings). 
The analysis below provides a situa-
tional overview of the children arriving at 
the EUís external borders in 2018, drawn 
from Frontexís newly collected data. 
Demography of arriving children
The year 2018 was marked by a lower 
number of arrivals of children at the 
EUís external borders (14 % fewer than 
in 2017). Nevertheless, one out of five ar-
rivals was a child (19 %). More than half 
(55 %) of those who arrived (28†313) were 
boys, whereas girls represented slightly 
more than one fifth (28 %) of child arriv-
als. For the remaining 17 %, the sex of the 
child was not provided. Syria, Afghani-
stan, Iraq, Morocco and Turkey were the 
main source countries of arriving chil-
dren, together accounting for 71 % of the 
total number. Similar to adult arrivals, 
the Eastern, Western and Central Med-
iterranean routes represented the main 
entry points for arriving children, each 
presenting a different demographic and 
nationality makeup.
In 2018, the Eastern Mediterranean 
route became the main entry point for 
children on their way to the EU, regis-
tering a 36 % increase in arrivals of this 
group (from 13†431 children in 2017 to 
18†259 in 2018), mostly due to a peak in 
the influx of Afghan and Turkish chil-
dren, whose numbers rose by 199 % and 
202 % respectively. While the status of 
children (whether accompanied or un-
accompanied) travelling via this route 
could not be unequivocally determined, 
available statistics and information sug-
gest that many of them were accom-
panied by family members, as the rise 
in child arrivals corresponded to an in-
crease in adults arriving from the same 
countries. 89 % of all children reported 
on the Eastern Mediterranean route in 
2018 hailed from four countries alone: 
Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Turkey. 
The remaining originated from various 
Middle Eastern, South Asian and Afri-
can countries, including Palestine, the 
Democratic Republic of Congo, Paki-
stan, Somalia and Iran. As regards sex, 
the Eastern Mediterranean saw a more 
balanced distribution, with boys repre-
senting 56 % of arrivals and girls 40 %.2 
Around three-fourths of all the arriv-
ing children were aged between 0 and 13 
years old, with most children in this age 
group coming from Middle  Eastern coun-
tries. African children on the other hand,

tended to be older, mostly aged between 
14 and 17 years old (64 % of arrivals).
In 2018, the Western Mediterranean 
route registered the highest increase in 
child arrivals (a 405% rise from 961 in 2017 
to 4†850 in 2018). Children represented 9% 
of the total migratory movement via this 
route. The Western Mediterranean route 
quickly overtook the Central Mediterra-
nean route in terms of child arrivals, 
where illegal border-crossings by chil-
dren have dramatically fallen since mid-
2017. Three-fifths of arrivals through the 
Western Mediterranean route concerned 
Moroccan children, whose number 
started to peak in May 2018. Moroccans 
were followed by Algerians and Guine-
ans, the second and third most highly 
represented nationality of children, also 
largely reflecting the main nationalities 
of arriving adult migrants. 
In 2018, the Central Mediterranean 
route registered its lowest number of 
child arrivals for three years (4†396 chil-
dren). The number of children travelling 
via this route was 74 % lower than that 
registered in 2017 and 73 % lower than in 
2016. Nevertheless, the arrival of chil-
dren via this route is of particular con-
cern, as the great majority of children 
(84 %) travelled unaccompanied. This sit-
uation was reflected in the two countries 
of arrival, Italy and Malta, where the 
share of unaccompanied children was, 
respectively, 85 % and 76 %. But whereas 
unaccompanied children from Soma-
lia, Sudan and Eritrea were the three 
largest groups in Malta (accounting for 
between 19 % and 23 %), in Italy unac-
companied children from Tunisia and 
Eritrea were most prevalent; these two 
nationalities were further followed by 
unaccompanied children from Guinea, 
Sudan, CÙte díIvoire, Pakistan, Mali and 
Somalia. 89 % of all the unaccompanied 
children who arrived in Malta during 
2018 were male and mostly aged 14ñ17 
years old. Girls, who accounted for only 
11 % of the total share of unaccompanied 
children, and originated in large meas-
ure from Somalia, were similar to unac-
companied boys, mostly aged between 
14 and 17 years old. 
Besides the three main routes of entry 
previously described, children were also 
reported arriving via the Western Afri-
can route, Western Balkan route, Eastern 
Borders route and the Circular route from 
Albania to Greece, albeit in much lower 
numbers. Together, the four routes ac-
counted for 3 % (808 children) of all child 
arrivals in 2018. Most of the children ar-
riving on these routes were boys (83 %), 
with girls mostly present on the Western 
Balkan route (28 %) and the Eastern Bor-
ders route (24 %). Despite the low num-
bers registered on the Eastern Borders 
route (120), almost half were unaccom-
panied children, mostly from countries 
such as Vietnam, Iraq and Russia. 
The year 2018 was also marked by an 
increase in clandestine entries by chil-
dren, not only at the external borders,

Search and rescue by Portuguese authorities ñ Themis Operation 2018

but also in the Member States. At the external bor-
ders, detections were mostly made at the Croatian-
Serbian border, involving mostly Afghan boys, few 
of whom were unaccompanied. Inland, detections of 
children travelling clandestinely were mostly made 
at the French-Italian border, as well as in Belgium, 
where the most detected nationality was Eritrean. In 
2018, Eritreans ranked as the top nationality of chil-
dren travelling clandestinely within the EU, a number 
that recorded a dramatic increase (five times higher) 
from 2017, when 115 detections were made. In Belgium 
in particular, 78 % of Eritrean children detected trav-
elling clandestinely. The protection of such children 
requires a proactive response and unified approach.
Challenges at the external borders
The continuing arrival of children (albeit at lower 
numbers) carries with it specific challenges and ad-
ditional concerns that require a proactive response 
and unified approach by the various actors present 
at the external borders. 
 <U+25AA> One of the challenges relates to the age assess-
ment, a key step in determining whether a per-
son will be treated as an adult or a child (with the 
respective safeguards and procedural and legal 
guarantees). Due to differences in treatment be-
tween adults and children, there have been a num-
ber of instances where adult migrants have falsely 
claimed to be under the age of 18. These cases are 
particularly problematic as they lead to abuses of 
legal systems in the Member States and deprive 
genuine children of the special protection meas-
ures reserved to them. 
 <U+25AA> No less worrisome however are the cases of children 
claiming to be adults in an attempt to circumvent 
the application of protective measures, perceived 
as a deterrent to the continuation of their journeys 
to the final destination. This method is often ex-
ploited by smugglers and traffickers to ensure that 
children are placed in open reception centres for 
adults, where it is easier to reach them. 
 <U+25AA> Additionally, the exponential increase in children 
at the external borders during the peak of the mi-
gration crisis, as well as their continuing arrival 
has put a strain on the reception capacity of MSs, 
especially in frontline countries. Cases have been 
reported of children placed in general reception 
centres with adults, which are often congested 
and ill-equipped and lack services that cater spe-
cifically to them. In these arrangements, children 
become exposed to severe security, physical and 
psychological risks and are increasingly at risk of

sexual abuse and gender-based vio-
lence. Furthermore, the different re-
ception conditions and prospects for 
integration across Member States act 
as catalysts for secondary movements 
of children, which create further pro-
tection challenges ñ by exposing them 
to the risk of trafficking in human 
beings and exploitation ñ and place 
additional pressure on national asy-
lum systems. 
The year 2018 saw important develop-
ments in the area of child protection at 
Frontex and in the Member States. Nev-
ertheless Frontexís data collection efforts 
could be improved to ensure that infor-
mation about whether children are with 
their families or unaccompanied is fully 
reported, as gaps hinder a proper as-
sessment of their situation, the timely 
identification of those more at risk and 
the provision of a tailored response that 
meets the specific needs of children. 
Especially important is the provi-
sion of information in a language and 
manner that the child can understand. 
Providing children with correct informa-
tion adapted to their language is crucial, 
as it can help to counteract the actions of 
smugglers and traffickers, as well as re-
assure children and increase their trust 
in the services and advice provided by 
the professionals they meet. 
Beyond data collection and access 
to information the provision of accom-
modation that is age-appropriate and 
responds to the specific needs of boys, 
girls, unaccompanied children and fam-
ilies with children must be ensured, par-
ticularly in Member States that host a 
higher number of children. In order to 
guarantee their protection, it is vital that 
children are prioritised in all border-re-
lated procedures (identification, regis-
tration and referral), and supported by 
specialised staff who use child-friendly 
and gender-sensitive approaches. 
In line with the significant scaling 
up of the Agencyís scope and size, pur-
suant to its Regulation, the European 
Border and Coast Guard is committed to 
ensuring the respect and protection of 
the rights of children on the move and 
Frontex in particular. It will continue to 
support Member States to ensure that 
children arriving at the external borders 
are identified and referred and that their 
best interests remain a key consideration 
throughout, whether in operational ac-
tivities, training, risk analysis and re-
search or other child-related activities.

6.3. Making return data more useful and 
an outlook for 2019
Sudden increases and peaks in irregu-
lar migration pressure, the emergence 
of new routes to Europe and the arrival 
of new migrant nationalities require in-
creased return efforts on the national 
and European level, e.g. for better co-
operation with the countries of origin. 
An analysis of existing data on irregular 
migration, asylum and returns helps to 
indicate the likely short- and medium-
term caseload for competent authorities.
Limitations however apply. A weak-
ness of the available quantitative data 
collected at Frontex, EASO and Eurostat 
is related to the fact that the figures ex-
isting under different indicators are not 
linked, e.g. via the persons subject to re-
turn procedures. The data does not for 
example contain any information about 
when persons returned to their country 
of origin were issued their return deci-
sion. The lack of a link between the in-
dicators leaves most of the facts related 
to return performance, length of proce-
dures, and possible reasons why returns 
could not be implemented in the dark. 
Other issues also impede the prepara-
tion of a satisfactory situational picture 
on return. Some Member States reported 
that, over time, several return decisions 
were issued to the same individuals. 
Although it is not possible to quantify 
the phenomenon, as data at EU level are 
anonymised and not linked to identifia-
ble persons, it illustrates the difficulty to 
effectively implement a return decision. 
Outlook ñ some of the potential 
return requirements in 2019
In spite of existing deficiencies, an anal-
ysis of available indicators on irregu-
lar migration, asylum and returns can 
still reveal at least some of the likely 
short-term requirements in operational 
planning and international cooperation 
and even indicate approximate mid-term 
needs in relation to returns. 
The trend in the number of return 
decisions issued to a certain national-
ity for example indicates the imminent 
return demand for the competent au-
thorities. A more extensive contextual 
analysis of recent data on irregular mi-
gration, asylum and returns could offer 
a toolset for identifying mid-term return 
requirements and preparing authorities 
to cope with the impending caseload. 
The following selection of nationalities 
gives some examples in that regard and 
was created on the basis of large, sudden 
or extraordinary changes in migration, 
asylum and return. The examples reflect 
potential return needs that are growing 
rather than those that are continuously 
significant but stable.
The example of citizens of Latin 
American countries and the 
Caribbean
In 2018, the number of EU/SAC-wide first-
time asylum applications of citizens of 
Latin American countries and the Car-
ibbean increased to more than 42†000, 
which is an increase of more than 50 % 
compared with 2017 and the highest an-
nual figure ever recorded by Eurostat. 
The increase was mainly caused by per-
sons from El Salvador, Honduras, Nica-
ragua, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela, 
which amounted to around three quar-
ters of the total in this group. Two thirds 
of the asylum applications submitted by 
nationals of Latin America and the Car-
ibbean were reported by Spain.
Persons from Latin America are rarely 
detected for illegal border-crossing or 
document fraud, because most nation-
alities are eligible for visa-free travel to 
the Schengen area. Many nationals of 
the region are detected for illegal stay. 
In 2018, the number of related cases in-
creased by 15 % to almost 21†000 cases.
In the first three quarters of 2018, 
Member States rejected around 8†700 
Latin American applicants for interna-
tional protection, indicating an asylum 
recognition rate of 21 %.1 The indicator 
of effective returns showed a long-term 
decrease, from around 15†000 in 2001 to 
around 9†000 in 2017. Only in 2018, the 
number started to increase again, re-
sulting in 9†376 effective returns. Around 
one third of the returns conducted in 
2018 were reported to be enforced. Re-
turns to El Salvador, Honduras, Nica-
ragua, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela, 
from where most irregular migrants in 
that region came from, were reported 
at a particularly low level, amounting 
to around 3†100.

Citizens of Latin American countries 
have been reported for illegal stay in the 
EU and Schengen area since Frontex data 
collection began. While before they were 
trying to remain undetected in order to 
benefit from the labour black market, 
only in 2017 and 2018 they increasingly 
applied for asylum. The increasing num-
ber of applications for international pro-
tection and the low recognition rate in 
2018 indicate the likelihood of an in-
creased number of return cases in 2019.
The example of nationals of 
West African countries
In 2018, arrivals of West African migrants 
remained large in absolute numbers, 
with a shift from the Central to the West-
ern Mediterranean route. While most 
irregularly arriving West African mi-
grants applied for asylum, only around 
a quarter received positive asylum deci-
sions, resulting in many persons being 
subject to return orders. Compared with 
2017, the number of return decisions re-
lated to this region increased by 80 %, to 
more than 40†000. In contrast, between 
2017 and 2018, the annual EU-wide num-
ber of effective returns to this region re-
mained low, at around only 5†200 cases.
The peak in irregular migration from 
West African countries was in fact re-
corded in 2016 and 2017, reaching fig-
ures of more than 110†000 and 75†000 
arrivals respectively, the vast majority 
of which were reported on the Central 
Mediterranean route. In those years, 
the annual number of return decisions 
issued to West Africans remained com-
parably low in front-line Member States. 
In 2018, in contrast, when the West-
ern Mediterranean became the main 
irregular migration route for West Af-
ricans, the number of return decisions 
issued to West Africans in Spain consid-
erably increased, despite fewer arrivals. 
The differences between the described 
situations of 2017 and 2018 highlight the 
need to harmonise return procedures in 
Member States. 
Although the EU-wide irregular mi-
gration pressure from nationals of West 
African countries declined, the drastic 
increase in the number of issued return 
decisions indicates an increased case-
load for European return authorities, 
especially since past levels of effective 
returns have remained very low.

6.4. From crisis response to preparedness: 
changing priorities in Member Statesí 
migration policy
Over the last few years, the European 
Union and its Member States have been 
facing major challenges related to migra-
tion and security. Armed conflicts and 
political instability in North Africa, the 
Sahel region and the Middle East have 
generated an unprecedented number of 
illegal border-crossings at the EUís ex-
ternal borders, and a ferocious wave of 
terrorist attacks ideologically related to 
these conflicts. These challenges have 
been answered on different levels, clearly 
highlighting the need for a comprehen-
sive approach to migration and security. 
The migration crisis brought Member 
States to perform policy changes in every 
sector concerned: border control, recep-
tion, law enforcement, international 
protection and asylum procedures, le-
gal migration channels, integration and 
returns. In the last two years, the num-
ber of illegal border-crossings has been 
decreasing, which partly brought Mem-
ber States to change their priorities and 
allocation of resources, from reception 
services and asylum to a greater focus on 
border control, secondary movements 
and returns.
At EU level, numerous resources have 
been allocated with the aim of imple-
menting the new mandate of the Euro-
pean Border and Coast Guard Agency, 
with ongoing projects to expand its man-
power and financial capabilities. Facili-
tating an efficient policy for returns has 
been a central concern for EU institu-
tions. The European Border and Coast 
Guard now provides enhanced techni-
cal and operational support to Member 
States in charter flights and scheduled 
flights, while several regulatory acts 
have been adopted in order to improve 
the number of effective returns. Like-
wise, border control and management 
have been key sectors concerned by EU 
institutionsí efforts, with regulation 
amending the Schengen Borders Code, 
the adoption in 2017 of the forthcom-
ing EU Entry/Exit System (EES) and the 
adoption in 2018 of the ñ equally forth-
coming ñ European Travel Information 
and Authorisation System (ETIAS). It is 
important to note that, in the current 
negotiations for the Multiannual Finan-
cial Framework (MFF) for 2021ñ2027, the 
EU Commission is proposing a particu-
larly strong focus on migration, protec-
tion of the external borders and internal 
security. 
Member States and border 
management
Several approaches have been adopted by 
Member States when dealing with the 
improvement of border control meas-
ures. Some have chosen to implement a 
comprehensive national strategy in order 
to facilitate the integrated management 
of external borders, whereas others have 
opted for the adoption of new legislation, 
mostly focused on identity checks pro-
cedures, management of flows at check-
points and procedures for surveillance 
operations along the borders. Measures 
conceived to improve the effectiveness of 
border control were also implemented by 
Member States, such as the recruitment 
and training of new border guards and 
staff, the allocation of larger financial 
resources, the construction or improve-
ment of infrastructure at border control 
posts and borderlines, and the reinforce-
ment of technical equipment. Several 
Member States, for example, recently 
increased their investments in tools for 
biometric ID checks, kiosks and Easy-
Pass posts. Also wide-ranging coopera-
tion with third countries has proven to 
be paramount in order to improve the 
effectiveness of external border controls. 
Member States have stepped up their di-
alogue with third countries and signed 
agreements involving the secondment 
and training of border guards, the es-
tablishment of share border/crossing 
points, the sharing of documents and 
data, the coordination of border patrol-
ling and the launch of joint awareness 
campaigns. In addition to enhancing co-
operation, several Member States have 
also adopted measures to fight fraud 
in family reunification, abuse of free 
movement, the use of false travel doc-
uments and the facilitation of irregu-
lar migration.
Increased focus on returns
Besides border control, return policies 
are the other topic that has been gaining 
relevance among Member Statesí current 
political focus. It has been understood 
that return decisions have to lead more 
consistently to effective returns, in order 
to maintain a well-functioning asylum 
system and coherent migration policy. 
Despite this awareness, however, effec-
tive returns remains a challenge. The EU 
Commission has called Member States to 
improve coordination among all the ser-
vices and the authorities involved in the 
process. Indeed, after the decrease in the 
influx of asylum seekers, several Mem-
ber States reported to the EMN that they 
started scaling down emergency meas-
ures they had taken at the peak of the 
crisis and have reallocated part of the re-
sources into return operations. In order 
to improve the return process, Member 
States have pursued cooperation, not 
only between the authorities at different 
levels, but also by concluding readmis-
sion agreements with third countries. 
The practice of voluntary returns is 
preferred to forced returns by Member 
States. This is highlighted by a num-
ber of recent policies aimed at increas-
ing their numbers, such as raising the 
cash based assistance to people accepting 
voluntary return schemes or to spread 
36 of 52
Frontex ∑ Risk Analysis for 2019
awareness of the existence of this option 
to asylum applicants, mainly through 
information campaigns. Entry bans are 
also being currently used more system-
atically by some Member States, espe-
cially applied to third-country nationals 
who have committed crimes or represent 
a serious threat to public order. On the 
side of forced returns, numerous Mem-
ber States have adopted measures, which 
have increased the maximal detention 
time prior to return operations, in order 
to mitigate the risk of absconding, while 
some are also planning to increase deten-
tion capacity with the opening of new 
centres. Nevertheless, these measures 
often seem to be insufficient.

7. Outlook and conclusions 
This chapter reviews the possible evolu-
tion of the situation along the external 
borders of the EU in the coming years. 
While some developments are likely to 
materialise, others seem possible, based 
on current knowledge. Past experiences 
demonstrate that there are a large num-
ber of unforeseeable events and factors 
that can have a profound and unpredicta-
ble impact on the situation at the border. 
The likely
Prevention activities by transit 
countries determine arrivals in the EU
The sudden uptick in activities by the 
Libyan Coast Guard in July 2017 was one 
of the key variables in irregular migra-
tion to Europe that changed from 2017 to 
2018. In all other countries in the direct 
EU neighbourhood, prevention activi-
ties stopped a higher number of irregu-
lar migrants arriving in the EU. 
In the future, too, the commitment to 
preventions of departure on every single 
route will directly determine the number 
of arrivals. Yet it is not only the political 
will, but also the institutional capacity 
to act upon it ñ the surveillance capac-
ities, their coordination and not least 
the manpower deployed ñ that deter-
mines the flow.
European border management will 
continue to be tested
On the other side of the coin, effective 
preventions may well in the short-term 
mean a rise in the numbers of would-be 
migrants in neighbouring third coun-
tries as few migrants are initially dis-
suaded from their goal of reaching the 
EU. In the longer run of course, num-
bers may dwindle as migrants make use 
of return schemes and fewer people fol-
low as the word of decreased chances of 
success inform the choices of would-be 
migrants in countries of origin. An in-
creasing number of migrants now have 
easy access to key neighbouring third 
countries, most notably Morocco and 
Turkey. Causing this is a mixture of le-
gal and institutional factors. 
The fact that these two countries, re-
ceiving vast amounts of support from the 
EU and bilaterally from Member States, 
saw, despite effective prevention activi-
ties, strong increases in the number of 
successful crossings in 2018 (compared 
with 2017) again serves as evidence that 
the overall migratory pressure has not 
declined. As displacement due to the ef-
fects of conflict and persecution is ris-
ing and the wealth gap between Europe 
and the Global South persists, it is likely 
that integrated European border man-
agement will continue to be tested in 
the future.
Systematic border checks will require 
further resources
Regular passenger flows across the ex-
ternal borders will in all likelihood con-
tinue to increase. On the demand side, 
global mobility is rising and on the 
supply side, global competition among 
38 of 52
Frontex ∑ Risk Analysis for 2019
airline carriers on long-range flights ñ as 
well as other effects such as low-cost car-
riers increasingly serving non-Schengen 
destinations ñ has kept down prices and 
is likely to continue to do so. While the 
overarching expert view is that in 2019, 
growth in the Eurozone will be subdued, 
economic fundamentals are considered 
strong, meaning variable spending on 
travel will continue to grow, too, if not 
at the same pace. This is only in addition 
to inter alia upticks in travel from recently 
visa liberalised neighbours and an appe-
tite for travel to Europe by Asiaís grow-
ing middle class. 
Increased passenger flows combined 
with systematic checks of all passengers 
mean increased responsibilities for bor-
der controls. Faced with this, border-
control authorities will need to increase 
resources where needed. The Vulnera-
bility Assessment helps identify where 
this is the case. In some instances, risk 
analysis may help to optimize scarce 
resources.
The possible
Sub-Saharan migrants could lead to 
new record in arrivals in Spain
Given that around 60 % of the migrants 
apprehended on the Western Mediter-
ranean Sea route in 2018 were sub-Sa-
haran, and considering the nationality 
makeup combined with information 
from debriefing interviews, it is clear 
that for migrants from West Africa, the 
Western Mediterranean route has be-
come the preferred pathway to Europe. 
The Central Mediterranean route is con-
sidered slower and more dangerous, and 
in short, has a lower chance of success. 
The ability by sub-Saharan migrants 
to legally or illegally enter neighbouring 
countries is therefore critical for the fu-
ture migratory pressure on the Western 
Mediterranean route.  
Exodus from Syriaís Idlib region 
could trigger a new uncontrollable 
migration wave
The situation in Syria continues to hold 
risks for further large-scale outflows 
of migrants. While the Syrian regime 
has reconquered much of the coun-
try, the opposition stronghold in Idlib 
province in the countryís north awaits 
an offensive by government forces. At 
the time of writing, the offensive has 
been postponed due to a Turkish-Rus-
sian agreement (the Sochi agreement) 
on a buffer zone. However, the Syrian 
regime is deemed determined to recon-
quer Idlib and the Sochi agreement has 
been threatened by clashes between ji-
hadists and the Syrian Arab army. Mil-
itary action in Idlib could lead to the 
displacement of hundreds of thousands 
of people northwards into Turkey. On 
this scale, a new migration wave to Eu-
rope could be difficult to rein.
Migratory pressure from Central and 
South America 
Asylum applications in Europe from na-
tionals of Central and South America, 
especially from Venezuela, have been 
rising since 2013. In fact, the growth in 
applications has picked up speed since 
2015, more than doubling from 2015 to 
2016 and again in 2017 according to Eu-
rostat. In 2018, around 42†000 asylum 
applications were believed to have been 
launched in Europe by nationals from 
Central and South America. As many 
nationalities in the region can travel to 
Europe without a visa, they mostly ar-
rived using legal channels on air routes 
(several hundred document fraud cases 
from the region were also reported). The 
countries of destination of course were 
largely aligned with the native language 
in the country of origin. Given develop-
ments in some countries in the region, 
there remains a lot more potential for 
migratory movements to Europe from 
the region ñ most consequential are de-
velopments in Venezuela, which has 
been torn apart by economic and politi-
cal upheaval. According to the UNHCR, 
3 million refugees and migrants have 
left Venezuela, the largest cross-border 
displacement of people in South Amer-
ican history. As neighbouring countries 
are declaring themselves at the limit of 
their capacity to host more migrants, 
the numbers attempting to migrate to 
Europe will possibly rise depending also 
on whether the visa freedom is upheld.
The unknown
As decisions to migrate are oftentimes 
rational choices under incomplete infor-
mation (for those who do in fact face a 
choice), it is the perception of costs and 
benefits that are weighed. How these 
perceptions are in fact formed is an intri-
cate process, and the information gained 
for example from personal networks and 
select media consumption is widely dif-
ferent between individuals. While there 
have been information campaigns to dis-
suade economic migrants, they are lim-
ited in scope. It is the media landscape 
that ultimately determines how desir-
able a future in Europe may seem, or 
what downsides to migration the indi-
vidual migrant believes he/she will face 
or will be confronted with. 
Finally, the threat of terrorism-related 
movements across the external borders 
remains, and is particularly dangerous 
given undetected arrivals on the shores 
of the EU continue to be a reality. As fu-
ture advancements in border checks such 
as ETIAS will make regular channels less 
attractive, organised crime groups will 
face an expanded demand for their ser-
vices and will innovate to circumvent 
detection.

Notes on FRAN data sources and methods 
The term ëMember Statesí refers to FRAN 
Member States, which includes the 28 
Member States and three Schengen As-
sociated Countries (Iceland, Norway and 
Switzerland). For the data concerning 
detections at the external borders of the 
EU, some of the border types are not 
applicable to all FRAN Member States. 
This pertains to data on all FRAN indi-
cators since the data are provided disag-
gregated by border type. The definitions 
of detections at land borders are there-
fore not applicable (excluding borders 
with non-Schengen principalities) for 
Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, 
France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, It-
aly, Luxembourg, Malta, the Nether-
lands, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland 
and the UK. For Cyprus, the land bor-
der refers to the Green Line demarcation 
with the area where the Government of 
the Republic of Cyprus does not exer-
cise effective control. For sea borders, 
the definitions are not applicable for 
land-locked Member States including 
Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Luxembourg, Slovakia and Switzerland. 
In addition, data on detections of il-
legal border-crossing at land, air and sea 
BCPs (1B) are not available for Iceland, 
Ireland and Spain, and in Greece these 
detections are included in the data for 
indicator 1A. 
Data on detections of illegal border-
crossing between sea BCPs (1A) are not 
available for Ireland. For 2013, data from 
Slovenia include detections at the EU ex-
ternal borders only until June 2013. 
Data on apprehension (FRAN Indi-
cator 2) of facilitators are not available 
for Ireland and UK. For Italy, the data 
are not disaggregated by border type, 
but are reported as total apprehensions 
(not specified). Data for Italy and Nor-
way also include the facilitation of ille-
gal stay and work. For Romania, the data 
include land Intra-EU detections on exit 
at the border with Hungary. 
For the data concerning detections 
of illegal stay (FRAN Indicator 3), data 
on detections on exit are not available 
for Ireland, Italy and the UK. Data on 
detections of illegal stay inland have 
not been available from the Netherlands 
since 2012. 
Data on refusals of entry (FRAN In-
dicator 4) at the external EU borders are 
not disaggregated by reason of refusal 
for Ireland and the UK. 
The data on passenger flow (shared on 
voluntary basis) are not available for Aus-
tria, Ireland, Sweden and the UK. Data 
on passenger flow at the air border are 
not available according to the definition 
for Spain. Data at the sea border are not 
available for Cyprus, Malta, Spain, the 
Netherlands, Romania and Denmark. 
For all indicators, data from Croatia 
are available only starting with July 2013.
