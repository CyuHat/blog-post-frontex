Frontex · Risk Analysis for 2018
1. Preface
The year 2017, the first full year for Fron-
tex as the European Border and Coast 
Guard Agency, saw a significant fall in 
the detections of illegal border-crossing 
along the EU’s external borders. This was 
mainly due to a drop in detections on 
the Eastern and Central Mediterranean 
migratory routes. The Western Balkans 
route also experienced a large fall in il-
legal border-crossings. 
The sudden plunge in the number of 
irregular migrants reaching Italy in mid-
2017 was the most noteworthy develop-
ment at the external borders of the EU 
since the implementation of the EU-Tur-
key statement in March 2016.
Nevertheless, the overall pressure 
on Europe’s external borders remained 
relatively high, and the Western Medi-
terranean route saw the highest num-
ber of irregular migrants since Frontex 
began systematically collecting data in 
2009. The increase became especially 
pronounced in the second half of the 
year when the number of nationals 
from the Maghreb countries (notably 
Moroccans, Algerians and Tunisians) 
rose significantly. 
The fluid situation at the EU’s ex-
ternal borders and the ever-changing 
modus operandi of the smugglers under-
lines the need for a European response 
to the shifting migratory pressure, with 
a strengthened Frontex playing a key 
part in channelling the necessary re-
sources. For the first time, the Euro-
pean Border and Coast Guard regulation 
clearly states that ‘the management of 
the external borders is a shared respon-
sibility of the Union and the Member 
States’. As a result, the Agency acts as the 
operational arm of the EU, and a partner 
for the Member States.
Frontex is a cornerstone of the EU’s 
area of freedom, security and justice. 
To help Europe better prepare for future 
challenges at its external borders, Fron-
tex has begun conducting vulnerability 
assessments in Member States and al-
ready shared its first findings with na-
tional authorities. In 2018, the agency 
will deploy its first liaison officers to 
EU Member States to cement our rela-
tions with our partners at the national 
level. Their duties will also include con-
tributing to future vulnerability assess-
ments. Their presence in the Member 
States will further illustrate that national 
authorities and the Agency together cre-
ate the European Border and Coast Guard.
The Agency has also taken on new 
tasks to help combat cross-border crime. 
Officers deployed by Frontex have helped 
Member States arrest hundreds of sus-
pected facilitators and detect fraudulent 
documents. Combatting document fraud 
and targeting the organised crime groups 
that are involved in producing fake and 
fraudulent documents are among the 
Agency’s priorities. These actions have a 
direct impact on the internal security of 
the EU as detection of document fraud, 
along with sharing intelligence collected 
at the external borders, is a key tool in 
combatting the terrorist threat.
The new Frontex, as the European Bor-
der and Coast Guard Agency, is more ac-
tive at the EU external borders than ever.

At any moment, the Agency has between 
1 300 and 1 800 officers from Member 
States deployed in its operations, many 
times the number from just a few years 
ago. In case of an emergency at Europe’s 
external borders, Frontex has at its dis-
posal 1 500 officers, along with additional 
vessels, aircraft, vehicles and other tech-
nical equipment. Frontex is more in-
volved than ever in different stages of 
migration management in the EU.
The Agency has taken large leaps in 
the area of returns to become an essen-
tial actor in law enforcement on the Eu-
ropean level. In 2017, Frontex assisted 
Member States in returning more than 
14 000 people whose asylum applications 
were rejected and who did not receive 
subsidiary status or were no longer eligi-
ble to remain in the EU. This was about 
a third more than the previous year and 
accounted for 9 % of the 151 398 effective 
returns conducted by Member States. To 
help address the challenges of returns, 
Frontex has a pool of return experts at 
the disposal of Member States organis-
ing return operations. 
Another key element of successful 
migration management is cooperation 
with the countries of origin and transit 
of migrants. From exchange of informa-
tion to cooperation on returns, Frontex 
has been increasingly active beyond the 
European Union. The Agency continues 
to strengthen its relations with the bor-
der authorities of third countries, espe-
cially on topics related to security issues.
In 2017, Frontex deployed additional 
liaison officers to non-EU countries – Ni-
ger and Serbia. The agency also has a li-
aison officer in Turkey. These officers 
work with the national authorities to 
strengthen cooperation in the fields re-
lated to border management and mon-
itor the flows on key migratory routes 
outside the EU. Frontex will continue 
to develop the network of liaison offic-
ers in countries outside the EU. 
The sea, especially along the Medi-
terranean routes, will remain the most 
active path for illegal crossing of the EU 
external borders, but also one of the most 
dangerous for migrant smuggling re-
quiring humanitarian assistance efforts. 
Frontex, the European Border and Coast 
Guard Agency, is leading the way to en-
hance the cooperation among various 
maritime security players, leading to ad-
ditional coordination in search and res-
cue efforts, as well as other coast guard 
functions related to border control. As a 
result, border control authorities are in-
creasingly involved in detection of cross-
border crimes, such as drug trafficking 
and smuggling of excise goods, but also 
the detection of pollution and illegal fish-
ing. While these synergies create new 
opportunities, they also require scaling 
up of border resources. 
Together with EU-Lisa and Europol, 
Frontex is already preparing for the im-
plementation of the European Travel 
Information and Authorisation System 
(ETIAS), whose core function will be to 
provide an additional layer of control over 
travellers by determining the eligibil-
ity of all visa-exempt non-EU nationals 
to travel to the Schengen Area. Fron-
tex will host the Central Unit of ETIAS, 
which will help improve internal secu-
rity, limit public health risks and iden-
tify persons who may pose a risk before 
they arrive at the EU’s external borders.
Amid its expanding role in the ar-
eas of border control and security, Fron-
tex has reorganised to reflect its many 
new responsibilities. Just over the last 
year, the Agency has grown by a third, 
to a staff of more than 530, and it will 
more than double by 2020. Together with 
its many partners, the growing Euro-
pean Border and Coast Guard Agency re-
mains committed to tackling the many 
challenges outlined in this report, help-
ing ensure security of Europe’s external 
borders, EU Member States and Euro-
pean citizens.

2. Summary
In 2017, Member States reported a further 
drop in the detections of illegal border-
crossing along the EU’s external bor-
ders, with 204 719 detections recorded 
that year. This represents a 60 % decrease 
compared with the 511 047 detections of 
2016 (and an 89 % decrease compared with 
the 1.8 million detections at the height 
of the migratory crisis in 2015).
This decrease was in particular as-
sociated with a significant drop in de-
tections on the Eastern Mediterranean 
(and secondary to it the Western Balkan 
route) and on the Central Mediterranean 
route. The strong rise in detections on 
the Western Mediterranean route, the 
displacement effects on the other routes 
and the absolute number of detections, 
which exceeds any total recorded in re-
cent history before the year 2014, to-
gether indicate that the pressure on the 
EU’s external border remains high. 
The sudden reversal in the numbers of 
irregular migrants detected on the Cen-
tral Mediterranean in July 2017 is argua-
bly the most significant development at 
the EU’s external borders since the im-
plementation of the EU-Turkey state-
ment. The numbers in the first half of 
2017 roughly mirrored those reported 
in 2016 at an elevated level, but in July, 
mostly due to internal developments in 
Libya, the numbers dropped suddenly to 
less than half the level of June. An even 
more marked relative decrease, to al-
most a third of that level, was registered 
in August; the numbers remained at a 
much lower level throughout the rest of 
the year. Unrelated to the decrease in de-
partures from Libya, more boats success-
fully left from the shores of Tunisia and 
Algeria in the third and forth quarters. 
At the EU’s external border with Tur-
key, the migratory pressure in 2017 re-
mained roughly on a level with the 
months after the implementation of 
the EU-Turkey statement. 
The number of migrants detected on 
the Western Mediterranean route hit a 
new record high in 2017, more than dou-
bling the previous record of last year. 
While during much of the first half of 
the year the numbers were on a par with 
those reported during the last months of 
2016, the flow reached a new level in June 
of the year. Domestic issues in Morocco, 
the main transit country for migrants 
heading to Spain, created an opening for 
more departures from Morocco’s western 
coast in particular, which starting from 
the second quarter of the year led to the 
use of high-capacity boats able to trans-
port large numbers of migrants.
Corresponding to the changes in the 
migratory routes, the relative share of 
African nationals increased compared 
with 2016, driven by fast-growing num-
bers of migrants from Maghreb countries 
(notably Moroccans, Algerians and Tuni-
sians) in the latter part of the year. As a 
result, African nationals accounted for 
almost two-thirds of irregular migrants 
arriving at the shores of the EU.
Regional differences are notable, 
however, as the number of Eastern Af-
rican nationals fell by a lot more than 
the relative decline in numbers caused 
by the curb imposed by developments in 
Libya would suggest: the numbers of Er-
itreans, Somalis and Ethiopians for in-
stance fell to roughly a fourth of their 
2016 numbers.
In 2017, Member States reported a to-
tal of 6 700 individuals from third coun-
tries who presented themselves with 
fraudulent documents at BCPs on en-
try to the EU/ Schengen area. In con-
trast to the decreasing trend observed at 
the external EU border, the number of 
document fraud detections on second-
ary movements within the EU/Schen-
gen area increased by more than 10 % 
and reached one of the highest num-
bers since 2013. 
Member States reported a drop in ille-
gal stay between 2016 and 2017, the sec-
ond year in a row when a decrease in the 
number of illegal stayers was recorded. 
This trend mirrored the fall in numbers 
of illegal border-crossings at the EU’s ex-
ternal borders. 
Despite a steady number of return 
decisions compared with 2016, in 2017 
Member States continued to struggle to 
effectively return those whose asylum 
application was rejected and who were 
not granted subsidiary protection status. 
While the effective returns of European 
and American migrants stayed roughly 
on a par with last year, the number of 
migrants returned to Africa and Asia fell 
further. Returns to West Africa continue 
to show the lowest ratio between effec-
tive returns and return decisions. In the 
meantime, the Agency offers Member 
States increased support in organising 
return operations, having returned more 
than 14 000 persons in 2017, which repre-
sents a 32 % increase compared with the 
previous year. 
Looking ahead, irregular migration 
by sea, and more specifically along the 
Mediterranean routes, will remain the 
main modus operandi for illegally cross-
ing the EU’s, external borders, and also 
one of the most dangerous forms of mi-

grant smuggling requiring humanitarian 
assistance efforts. To tackle this phe-
nomenon, cooperation among maritime 
security players and the shared use of 
assets are gaining momentum. Border 
control authorities are increasingly con-
fronted with the detection of cross-bor-
der crimes such as drug trafficking and 
the smuggling of excise goods, but also 
the detection of pollution and fisher-
ies issues. While synergies offer oppor-
tunities, they also require adaptation 
and scaling-up of border and coast guard 
resources.
At the same time, border-control au-
thorities are expected to be increasingly 
engaged in search and rescue operations 
covering vast areas of the Mediterranean 
Sea, as well as being the first point of 
contact for a growing number of vul-
nerable persons. The proportion of Af-
rican migrants, and in particular West 
African migrants, detected crossing the 
border illegally is likely to grow.
Swift diversification of modi operandi, 
displacement between routes or border 
types, and attempts to evade detection 
or identification are all likely to occur 
in response to enhanced surveillance 
and migration control. While until re-
cently, migrants detected at the border 
could swiftly continue to their final des-
tinations unhindered, the emerging pat-
tern is that migrants who go undetected 
can arrive at their destination quickly; 
it also means that they do not have to 
bear the consequences of being detected 
for illegal stay or being refused asylum. 
Hence, the number of migrants under-
taking secondary movements is also ex-
pected to rise.
Regular passenger flows across the ex-
ternal border will increase significantly 
in the coming years due to rising global 
mobility. Border-control authorities will 
have to take on more responsibilities 
as a consequence of visa liberalisation 
processes and local border traffic agree-
ments. Border management will in-
creasingly be risk-based, to ensure that 
interventions are focused on the move-
ments of high-risk individuals, while 
movements of bona fide travellers are 
facilitated smoothly.
Given the increasing level of security 
features in modern travel documents and 
stricter migration policies across Mem-
ber States, the misuse of genuine travel 
documents (which includes imperson-
ation and fraudulently obtained docu-
ments) is likely to be an entry method 
which will become more widespread.
Finally, there is an underlying threat 
of terrorism-related travel movements 
and it is possible that foreign terrorist 
fighters use irregular migration routes 
or facilitation networks.

3. Introduction
The Frontex Risk Analysis for 2018 has 
been specifically designed to provide an 
overview which will help make informed 
decisions on both common European 
investments and concerted actions to 
improve the management of external 
borders and uphold the internal secu-
rity of the Union.
Frontex operational activities aim at 
strengthening border security through 
the coordination of Member States’ ac-
tions regarding the implementation of 
EU measures for the management of ex-
ternal borders. The coordination of oper-
ational activities contributes to a more 
efficient allocation of Member States’ re-
sources and better protection of the area 
of freedom, security and justice. In this 
context, the Risk Analysis for 2018 con-
centrates on the scope of Frontex oper-
ational activities and, in particular, on 
irregular migration at the external bor-
ders of the EU and Schengen Associated 
Countries.
Since the Regulation (EU) 2016 / 1624 
came into effect, the mandate of Fron-
tex has been significantly enhanced to 
ensure efficient implementation of Euro-
pean Integrated Border Management as 
a shared responsibility of the Union, the 
Agency and of the national authorities.
The European Integrated Border Man-
agement consists of 11 strategic compo-
nents defined in Article 4 of the Agency’s 
Regulation. These are: border control, 
including measures in relation to traf-
ficking in human beings and terrorism, 
search and rescue operations, analysis 
of risks for internal security, coopera-
tion with Member States, inter-agency 
cooperation, cooperation with third 
countries, measures within the Schen-
gen area related to border control, re-
turn of third-country nationals, use 
of state-of-the-art technology, qual-
ity control mechanisms and solidarity 
mechanisms.
Clearly, this major change has im-
portant implications for the analytical 
work performed by Frontex as its risk 
analysis should cover all aspects of Inte-
grated Border Management and develop 
a pre-warning mechanism. Therefore, as 
much as possible, these new elements 
have been integrated into this annual 
risk analysis. 
This annual report is structured as 
follows: (1) situational picture with em-
phasis on identified migratory trends 
and surveillance activities utilising a 
set of reliable indicators on irregular 
migration; (2) featured analyses on key 
risks affecting the security of the exter-
nal borders and / or internal security; 
(3) presentation of outlook; and finally 
(4) highlights on the main types of risks 
at the external borders.
The Agency and in particular its Risk 
Analysis Unit (RAU) would like to ex-
press its gratitude to all members of the 
Frontex Risk Analysis Network (FRAN) in 
Member States for their efforts in pro-
viding data and information, as well as 
Europol, the European Asylum Support 
Office (EASO), and all colleagues involved 
in the preparation of this report.

4. Methodology
A coherent and comprehensive analy-
sis of the risks affecting security at the 
external borders requires, above all, the 
adoption of common indicators. Consist-
ent monitoring of these indicators will 
allow effective measures to be taken on 
the ground. The analysis needs to iden-
tify the risks that arise at the external 
borders themselves and those that arise 
in third countries.
The backbone of the Risk Analysis for 
2018 is the monthly statistics exchanged 
among Member States within the frame-
work of the FRAN. For the Risk Analy-
sis for 2018, the key indicators collected 
through the FRAN were: detections of il-
legal border-crossing through the green 
border or at BCPs; refusals of entry; de-
tections of illegal stay; detections of 
facilitators; detections of fraudulent 
documents; return decisions; effec-
tive returns and passenger flow data 
(when available). Data on asylum appli-
cations are still being collected within 
the FRAN, but Frontex increasingly re-
lies on data collected by EASO, which 
has contributed to the dedicated sec-
tion on asylum.
The data were categorised by border 
type (land, air or sea) and those on land 
borders were additionally grouped by 
border section with neighbouring third 
countries. The data exchanged within 
the FRAN are compiled and analysed on 
a quarterly basis. Priority is given to the 
use of the data for management purposes 
and to their fast sharing among Member 
State border-control authorities.
Member States’ data processed by 
Frontex are not treated as official statis-
tics and thus may occasionally vary from 
those officially published by national au-
thorities. Throughout 2017, some FRAN 
members performed backdated updates 
of their 2016 statistics. These updates 
have been accounted for in this docu-
ment, hence some data presented here 
may differ from those presented a year 
ago in the Risk Analysis for 2017. 
Member States were not requested to 
answer specific questions in support of 
this analysis. Rather, bimonthly analyt-
ical reports and incident reports of Mem-
ber States routinely collected within the 
FRAN, as well as other Member States’ 
contributions submitted in 2017 were 
important sources of information, es-
pecially as regards the analysis of routes 
and modi operandi. Additionally, the out-
comes of debriefing activities carried 
12 of 54

out in the framework of Joint Opera-
tions constituted essential analytical 
material.
Open-source information was also ef-
fectively exploited, especially in identi-
fying the main push and pull factors for 
irregular migration to the EU. Among 
others, these sources included reports 
issued by government agencies, inter-
national and non-governmental organ-
isations, as well as mainstream news 
agencies and official EU reports.
External borders, a term often used 
in this report, refer to the borders be-
tween Member States and third coun-
tries. The borders between the Schengen 
Associated Countries (Norway, Iceland, 
and Switzerland) and third countries are 
also considered as external borders. By 
contrast, the borders between the Schen-
gen Associated Countries and Schengen 
Member States are considered as internal 
borders. For the indicators on detections 
of facilitators, illegal stay and asylum, 
statistics are also reported for detections 
at the land borders between Schengen 
Member States and those Member States 
that have either not joined the Schen-
gen area yet (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, 
Romania) or have opted to stay out of it 
(the United Kingdom, Ireland). Thus, a 
total for Member States and Schengen 
Associated Countries as a whole can be 
presented. It was not possible to make 
the aforementioned distinction for air 
and sea borders because Member States 
do not habitually differentiate between 
extra-EU and intra-EU air and sea con-
nections but tend to aggregate data for 
all arrivals per airport. 
Consistent with other law-enforce-
ment indicators, variation in admin-
istrative data related to border control 
depends on several factors. In this case, 
the number of detections of illegal bor-
der-crossing and refusals of entry are 
both functions of the amount of effort 
spent, respectively, on detecting mi-
grants and the actual flow of irregular 
migrants to the EU. For example, in-
creased detections of illegal border-cross-
ing might be due to a real increase in the 
flow of irregular migrants, or may in fact 
be an outcome of more resources made 
available to detect them. In exceptional 
cases, increased resources may produce 
a rise in reported detections while effec-
tively masking the actual decrease in the 
irregular migratory flow, resulting from 
a strong deterrent effect.

5.1. Main trends
In 2017, illegal border-crossings dropped 
to the lowest aggregate number since 
2013, in particular due to a significant 
decrease in detections on the Eastern 
Mediterranean and secondary to it on the 
Western Balkan route. While the compar-
ison on the annual basis shows that these 
two routes had the the most significant 
decline in absolute numbers, arguably, 
after the implementation of the EU-Tur-
key statement and regaining control of 
the Western Balkan transit corridor, the 
most significant development took place 
on the Central Mediterranean route. On 
this route, a sudden reversal took place in 
July 2017 which led to a marked drop in 
the number of detections of illegal bor-
der-crossing. Against these notable de-
creases in numbers, however, the rise in 
detections on the Western Mediterranean 
stands out. In particular the development 
on the Western Mediterranean and the 
noticeable diversion effects in the Cen-
tral and Eastern Mediterranean would 
suggest that while the actual pressure 
on the external borders remained high, 
effective action taken by Member States 
and the EU prevented this pressure from 
materialising.
According to EASO, in 2017, as many 
as 701 997 applications for international 
protection were lodged in the 28 EU Mem-
ber States plus Norway and Switzerland 
(EU+).1 This represents half the number

December 2017 were available for 25 
of the 30 EU+ countries. Missing data 
for December for Bulgaria, Greece,

Similarly, weekly estimates were used

of applications that were lodged in the 
EU+ during the previous year. Of the ap-
plicants in 2017, 8 % had previously sub-
mitted an application in the same EU+ 
reporting country (repeated applicants).
In 2017, the reported detections of il-
legal border-crossing remained consist-
ently lower than the level of applications, 
suggesting that some of the applicants 
for international protection had entered 
Europe earlier, crossed the border unde-
tected, or under a visa-free scheme. Some 
evidence suggests that the second and 
third reasons led to increases, although it 
is difficult to quantify these phenomena.
In 2017, there were over 111 823 with-
drawn applications, a 36 % decrease com-
pared with 2016.2 The two main countries 
receiving applications – Germany and 
 Italy – together accounted for half of all 
withdrawals. 
In 2017, border-control authorities for 
the Schengen area continued to devote 
the majority of their efforts to entry and 
exit checks. This obligation increased 
significantly in 2017 when a regulation 
was adopted obliging Member States to 
carry out systematic checks against rele-
vant databases on all persons, including 
those enjoying the right of free move-
ment under EU law when they cross the 
external borders. The amendment to 
the Schengen Borders Code came into

Asylum Procedures Directive (2013/32/
EU), an application can be withdrawn 
either explicitly (where the applicant 
informs officially the determining 
body of their wish to discontinue their 
application) or implicitly (where an 
applicant can no longer be located 
and is judged to have abandoned the 
procedure). At the time of writing, data 
for December 2017 were available for 26 of 
the 30 EU+ countries.

effect on 7 April 2017. While this has sig-
nificantly impacted the work of border 
guards, so did ever-increasing passen-
ger flows, which continue to be driven by 
visa liberalisation and local border traf-
fic agreements as well as ever-increas-
ing passenger numbers. These are most 
visible at the air borders as a result of in-
creased mobility and the rapid expansion 
of the supply of more affordable flight 
options.
As regards to visa liberalisation, the 
most significant development was the 
decision to transfer Ukraine to the list of 
third countries whose nationals (using 
a biometric passport) are exempt from 
visa requirements, which came into ef-
fect on 11 June 2017. For the three months 
post-visa liberalisation (July-September), 
the size of the passenger flow of Ukrain-
ians heading to the Schengen area in-
creased by 15 % compared with the same 
period one year before. Georgian citizens 
holding a biometric passport are also ex-
empt from the visa requirement since 28 
March 2017.
Concerning the passenger flow at the 
air border, Eurostat data – the latest avail-
able data being that for 2016 – suggests a 
continuation of the gradual year-to-year 
increase in passenger transport by air, al-
beit not as fast as in the previous couple 
of years. The EU-28 data (excluding Greece 
and the United Kingdom for incomplete 
datasets for 2016) showed a 1.5 % increase 
compared with a 4.4 % increase from 2014 
to 2015 (for EU-28). 
At the land border, for the 13 Mem-
ber States reporting data to Frontex, the 
number of passengers increased from 110 
337 008 (in 2016) to 112 468 517 (in 2017). 
The Croatian external land border – in 
particular the border section with Bosnia 
and Herzegovina – continued to receive 
an inward passenger traffic far beyond 
that of other Member States, remaining 
roughly at 35 million in 2017. 
In 2016, 13.9 million short-term uni-
form Schengen visas were issued, a de-
crease of almost 3 % compared with 2015. 
This further fall in issued short-term uni-
form Schengen visa was due to a variety 
of factors: for instance, a visa waiver 
agreement for Colombians, which came 
into effect in December 2015, led to a de-
crease in the number of visas issued to 
them by over 120 000 between 2015 and 
2016. Likewise, a short-stay visa waiver 
agreement with Peru entered into effect 
in March 2016, which resulted in a drop 
in the aggregate number of visas by an-
other 50 000. Other significant changes 
in absolute numbers were a decline of 
over 220 000 visas for Chinese citizens, 
a further drop in Russian visas by over 
310 000 and an increase in visas issued 
to Ukrainians by over 170 000.
In 2017, a total of 183 548 refusals of 
entry were reported at the external bor-
ders of the EU, a fall of 15 % compared 
with 2016.
In 2017, Member States reported 
around 6 700 persons fraudulently us-
ing documents at the external borders, 
the lowest number since 2012. By con-
trast, the number of document fraud 
detections within the EU/Schengen area 
increased by almost 9 % and reached its 
second highest number since 2013.
The number of detections of illegal stay 
– 435 786 reported by Member States – fell 
by 11 % for the second year in a row after 
the year of the height when the migra-
tion crisis reached its peak (2015). In 2017, 
too, illegal stayers were largely detected 
on secondary movements; they were mi-
grants who entered the EU/Schengen area 
on the Central Mediterranean route. 
In 2017, facilitators, who continue to 
pose a serious threat to the EU, managed 
to successfully operate mostly out of third 
countries and thus, mostly out of the 
reach of Member States’ law enforcement 
agencies. Overall, the number of reported 
facilitators fell by 19 %, a decline partly 
explained by the modi operandi newly 
adopted by smuggling networks and the 
general increase in their level of sophisti-
cation. Europol noted that more sophis-
ticated and dangerous methods are used 
by criminals to smuggle migrants across 
borders. For instance, cases of migrants 
being detected in purpose-built, airtight 
compartments in vans, lorries, cars and 
cargo trains are increasingly reported. 
Despite reporting a steady number of 
return decisions compared with 2016, 
Member States continued to struggle to 
effectively return those whose asylum 
application was rejected and who were 
not granted subsidiary protection sta-
tus. While the effective returns of Eu-
ropean and American migrants stayed 
roughly on a par with last year, the num-
ber of migrants returned to Africa and 
Asia fell further. Particularly, returns to 
West Africa continue to show the lowest 
ratio between effective returns and re-
turn decisions.

Figure 1. Detections of illegal border-crossing, by main nationalities  
(scale in absolute numbers, with labels showing percentages of total) in 2017 
decline in the pool of migrants looking 
to use the route. Hence, with 118 962 mi-
grants detected in 2017, a fall of 34 % com-
pared with 2016 was reported, meaning 
that the Central Mediterranean still re-
corded by far the largest number of ir-
regular migrants. In the second part of 
the year, migrants were increasingly pre-
vented from departing from Libya. At the 
same time, but unrelated to the decrease 
in the flow from Libya, more Tunisians 
and Algerians embarked boats in their 
For the second year in a row after the re-
cord year of 2015, Member States reported 
a significant decrease in the numbers 
of detections of illegal border-crossing 
along the EU’s external borders. The 
204 719 detections reported by Member 
States in 2017 represent a 60 % decrease 
compared with the 511 047 detections of 
2016. However,  this should not distract 
from the fact that the aggregate exceeds 
any total reported in FRAN history be-
fore the year 2014, an indicator that the 
migratory pressure on the EU’s exter-
nal borders remained very high in 2017. 
This decrease mostly resulted from the 
lower number of detections recorded on 
the Eastern Mediterranean, the West-
ern Balkan and the Central Mediterra-
nean routes. 
Central Mediterranean route
The number of irregular migrants detected 
on the Central Mediterranean route at the 
beginning of 2017 roughly mirrored that 
seen at the beginning of 2016, with fluc-
tuations very much dependent on weather 
conditions in the winter months. After 
January, however, the registered num-
bers were at an elevated level compared 
with 2016 due to even higher migratory 
pressure from Libya than in the year be-
fore. A trend similar to that observed in 
2016 continued until June 2017 (23 461 in 
June 2017 versus 22 344 in June 2016). In 
July 2017, the numbers dropped suddenly 
and markedly to less than half the level 
of June and July (11 460), followed by an 
even larger fall to almost a third of that 
level in August (3 914). A variety of fac-
tors, notably internal developments in 
Libya, are deemed to be the cause, not a

respective countries and headed to Sic-
ily and Sardinia. Finally, the Turkey- It-
aly maritime corridor remained open to 
smugglers, who nevertheless transported 
fewer migrants in 2017.
Eastern Mediterranean route
At the EU’s external border with Turkey, 
the migratory pressure in 2017 remained 
roughly on a level with the months af-
ter the implementation of the EU-Turkey 
statement (ranging from 1 601 to 7 136 de-
tected illegal border-crossings per month 
in 2017). Therefore, the statement has 
continued to prevent a large share of de-
partures. Regarding the sea border, the 
comparison between preventions of de-
partures and apprehensions seems to indi-
cate that the overall number of attempts to 
cross the Eastern Aegean reached a higher 
level, particularly in September. On the 
Greek land border with Turkey, 5 540 re-
ported illegal border-crossings represented 
the highest number of detections since 
2012. This is, alongside the temporary 
re-emergence of detections in the Black 
Sea, the outcome of diversion effects as 
the route via the Eastern Aegean islands 
is becoming less attractive, while at the 
same time a large pool of potential mi-
grants remain stranded in Turkey. Fur-
thermore, strengthened controls on the 
Western Balkan route and both the num-
ber of people stuck on the Hotspot islands 
and the Greek mainland and/or their wait-
ing time means that the amount of docu-
ment fraud detections at Greek air borders 
to Western Europe, as well as the smug-
gling activity via the Ionian Sea (1 465), 
increased.
Black Sea route
The Black Sea route was temporarily used 
in 2017, with 537 migrants detected on 
the Black Sea between August and No-
vember, accounting for the highest 
number of migrants ever detected on 
this route since 2009.
Western Balkan route
The flow of migrants across the Western 
Balkans continued to somewhat reflect 
the influx on the Eastern Mediterranean 
route, yet at a lower level compared with 
previous years given the continuing ef-
forts made on the route to curb the flow. 
The detected illegal border-crossings at 
the EU’s external border mostly took 
place at the Serbian borders, with many 
migrants stranded in Serbia known to 
make several attempts to cross, often at 
different border sections. 
Western Mediterranean route
The numbers of migrants detected on 
the Western Mediterranean route hit a 
new record high in 2017, more than dou-
bling the previous record of last year. 
While during much of the first half of 
the year the numbers were on a par with 
those reported during the last months 
of 2016, the flow reached new levels in 
June 2017. In the latter part of the year, 
the observed increased usage of rubber 
dinghies east of the Strait of Gibraltar 
– used by sub-Saharan migrants – sug-
gests increased activity of people smug-
gling networks, as the dinghies and the 
required engines are unlikely to have 
been procured by the (mostly sub-Saha-
ran) migrants themselves. 
Western African route
On the Western African route, the 421 
detected irregular migrants represent 
the lowest number since 2015. The low 
number on the route connecting Sene-
gal, Mauritania and Morocco with the 
Spanish Canary Islands is a success to 
be attributed to the Memorandum of 
Understanding between Spain, Sene-
gal and Mauritania, which continued 
to deliver joint surveillance activities 
and effective returns of people detected 
crossing the border illegally. 
Eastern land border route
In 2017, the Eastern land border reported 
the lowest number of illegal border-
crossings since the inception of FRAN 
data collection. In particular, at the 
land borders with Russia the numbers 
dropped, indicating that the Russian au-
thorities are continuing good coopera-
tion with the respective Member States’ 
local authorities. More than one-third 
of detected migrants were  Vietnamese 
citizens.

5.3. Clandestine entries
In 2017, the number of detections of clan-
destine entry (people hiding in vehicles 
to avoid border control) at BCPs remained 
much lower than the number of detec-
tions of illegal border-crossing between 
BCPs. There was a significant decrease 
(-27 %) in detections of clandestine entry 
compared with 2016, from 2 219 to 1 618. 
However, it is unlikely that the attempts 
to enter the EU’s external borders actu-
ally decreased given the measures taken 
to control irregular migration between 
BCPs (which should increase the incen-
tive to attempt clandestine entry), and 
so this number may well be an indica-
tion that more attempts of clandestine 
entry were successful.
The fall in the numbers of detected 
clandestine entries is due to two oppos-
ing phenomena: at the Bulgarian land 
border with Turkey, detections fell to al-
most an eighth of the number of 2016, 
whereas at the Croatian land border with 
Serbia the detections rose significantly. 
The latter is likely connected to a signif-
icant fall at the Hungarian land border 
with Serbia, which likely created the 
diversion effect at the Croatian border.
In terms of the nationalities of mi-
grants detected trying to enter clandes-
tinely, two saw significant changes. The 
number of Afghan nationals increased 
considerably (from 233 in 2016 to 489 in 
2017) whereas the number of Syrians de-
creased significantly (from 667 to 113). 
The fall in detections of clandestine 
entries at the EU’s land border with Tur-
key raises questions about the effective-
ness of checks. In light of this and taking 
into account the fact that thoroughly 
checking all vehicles would introduce 
undue waiting time for many bona fide 
travellers, the advancement of opera-
tional risk analysis techniques for bet-
ter results of targeted checks must be 
considered anew. The role of pooled in-
telligence at EU-level, as well as techni-
cal and other support to Member States, 
is in this regard paramount.

5.4. Refusals of entry
In 2017, a total of 183 548 refusals of en-
try were reported along the external bor-
ders of the EU, a 15 % drop compared with 
2016 and thus, an even smaller share of 
the increasing passenger flow. While Po-
land issued the most refusals of entry, 
their number dropped most in relative 
and absolute terms due to drops in refus-
als of Russians, Tajiks and Armenians. 
Nonetheless, the number of refusals of 
entry issued by Greece more than dou-
bled, a development entirely resulting 
from the increased refusals issued to 
Albanians. This increasing trend of re-
fusals of entry issued to Albanians was 
observed at EU level at all border types 
starting in 2014 (Figure 3). 
The overall fall in the refusals of en-
try was the effect of differing, opposing 
trends observed at the different border 
types – while refusals at both air (+6 %) 
and sea borders (+19 %) increased signif-
icantly, the drop at land border (-22 %) 
outweighed both, as the number of re-
fusals reported at this type of border is 
twice as large as the number recorded at 
both air and sea borders. 
At sea borders, the increases were par-
ticularly marked at the Italian ports of 
Bari and Brindsi, and the Spanish port 
of Tarifa. Given the connections from 
the aforementioned ports, the top na-
tionalities refused entry at sea borders 
were Albanians (from 3 744 to 4 521 refus-
als) followed by Moroccans (from 985 to 
1 830 refusals).
At the land border, the significant de-
crease in refusals of entry almost entirely 
resulted from the decreases reported at 
the Polish-Belarusian land border. Com-
pared with 2016, the number of refus-
als decreased in particular with regard 
to Russians (by 44 973), as well as Ta-
jiks (4 632). 
At the air border, the number of re-
fusals of entry issued to citizens of Al-
bania increased from 5 141 in 2016 to 
6 577 in 2017.
Since 2009, refusals at the sea and 
air borders remained relatively stable, 
despite incresing passenger flow at the 
air border. At the land border, where 
most refusals take place, a sharp de-
creased was reported between 2016 and 
207, mostly due to the decreasing num-
ber of Russians refused entry.

5.5. Fraudulent documents
In 2017, Member States reported a total 
of about 6 7001 persons from third-coun-
tries presenting themselves with fraud-
ulent documents at BCPs on entry to the 
EU/Schengen area, the lowest number 
of detections since 2013, despite the in-
creasing regular passenger flows. In con-
trast to the decreasing trend observed at 
the EU’s external border, the number of 
document fraud detections on second-
ary movements within the EU/Schengen 
area increased by almost 9 % and reached 
its second-highest number since 2013. 
This development mainly resulted from 
the significant increases in departures 
from Greece involving Syrian, Afghan, 
Iraqi, Turkish and Iranian nationals. 
At EU level, of the 138 nationalities 
detected using fraudulent documents 
to illegally enter the EU or the Schengen 
area from a third country, the most com-
monly detected were Moroccans (803), 
Ukrainians (801), Iranians (438), Albani-
ans (346), Russians (278) and Turks (275).

A remarkable development was recorded 
with regard to the detected Ukrainians, 
whose numbers dropped significantly 
compared with the previous year. As a 
result, Moroccan nationals became the 
most reported nationality using fraud-
ulent documents. Apart from these two 
nationalities, the number of Iranians de-
tected with fraudulent documents cross-
ing the EU’s external borders started 
increasing. To a certain extent, this is 
caused by the visa-free regime granted 
to Iranian nationals by the Serbian au-
thorities. In general, there were no sig-
nificant changes to the top five most 
reported nationalities detected with 
fraudulent documents on entry to the 
EU/Schengen area from third countries, 
apart from the fact that Russians re-
placed Iraqis in comparison to the pre-
vious year. Also, the number of Russian 
nationals detected in 2017 almost dou-

remains the top departure 
airport for detections of 
fraudulent documents from 
third countries
As in the previous year, most detections 
were reported on air routes. At 477 detec-
tions, the number of document fraud 
cases from Istanbul Atatürk decreased 
by 23 % compared with 2016. Despite re-
porting the lowest number of document 
fraud cases since 2013, Istanbul Atatürk 
airport, remains the most reported last 
departure airport outside the EU/Schen-
gen area.
The second-most reported last de-
parture airport remained Dakar Inter-
national Airport in Senegal with 222 
detected persons using fraudulent doc-
uments to cross the EU’s external border; 
Senegalese nationals were most often de-
tected on the above mentioned routes. 
Compared to 2016, in 2017 more de-
tections were reported at EU level on ar-
rival from Tirana’s airport.

At land and sea borders, most 
detections of document fraud 
were from Ukraine, Serbia and 
Morocco 
In 2017, most of the document fraud 
cases at land borders were reported be-
tween Ukraine and Poland (519), mainly 
involving Ukrainian nationals holding 
fraudulently-obtained Polish visas. How-
ever, the visa liberalisation regime for 
Ukrainian nationals, which entered into 
force in June 2017, had also contributed to 
the decrease in the number of Ukrainians 
misusing fraudulently obtained visas. 
With regard to the external sea bor-
ders, no change was observed in com-
parison to previous years. The sea border 
between Spain and Morocco remains 
most affected, with Ceuta as the most 
reported BCP and Moroccan nationals 
as the main nationality. 
On exit to third countries 
Ukraine remains the most-
reported destination, followed 
by Canada
Typically, land borders with Ukraine are 
affected and as regards the air routes, 
mostly Canada is targeted as the in-
tended final destination. At the land 
border with Ukraine, most detections 
concerned counterfeited stamps to con-
ceal overstaying. At the air borders, the 
types of forgeries are more diverse, and 
so are the risks associated with these 
detections.

Illegal stayers
In 2017, Member States reported a drop 
in illegal stay compared with 2016, the 
second year in a row with a decrease 
in illegal stay numbers. This is mostly 
connected with the lower numbers of 
detected illegal border-crossings at the 
EU’s external borders, as the illegal stay 
detections are primarily a reflection of 
them. Despite the significant decrease 
since 2015, the high absolute number 
indicates the persistence of the prob-
lem. The majority of detections con-
tinue to be associated with the spillover 
effect of secondary movements of mi-
grants who entered the EU/Schengen 
area on the Central Mediterranean 
route. On the other hand, the number 
of persons detected on exit at BCPs at the 
EU’s external borders without a valid 
permission to stay remained roughly 
on a par with 2016. 
Inland detections of illegal stay de-
creased particularly in Germany, Aus-
tria, Switzerland, as well as Bulgaria. 
The share of illegal stayers increased in 
France, which therefore replaced Ger-
many as the country with the highest 
number of illegal stay cases.
Facilitators
Member States reported 10 213 facilita-
tors in 2017, a 19 % decrease compared 
with 2016. Both Italy and Spain reported 
fewer facilitators (and thus were mostly 
responsible for the decline in aggregate 
numbers). 
Asylum applications
In 2017, according to EASO, 701 997 appli-
cations for international protection were 
lodged in the 28 EU Member States plus 
Norway and Switzerland (EU+). The three 
main countries of origin of applicants in 
the EU+ were Syria (97 619 applications), 
Iraq (48 771), and Afghanistan (46 533). 
Syrians continuously represented be-
tween 13 % and 16 % of all applicants. 
Citizens from Iraq applied in higher 
numbers in the second half of the year.
The relocation scheme ended in Sep-
tember 2017, but relocations of persons 
already registered for the process con-
tinued. According to EASO in 2017, 23 238 
persons were relocated, half of whom 
were Syrian nationals, a third Eritreans, 
and one tenth Iraqi. Altogether, there 
were 33 168 persons relocated from both 
Italy and Greece since the launch of the 
mechanism. 
The implementation of the EU-Turkey 
statement continued with 11 354 people 
resettled from Turkey to the EU+ under 
the statement1, while slower progress was 
noted in terms of returns to Turkey when 
the total number of returnees reached 
2 082 persons by the end of 20172, with 
many cases being subsequently appealed. 
Several policy-related developments 
took place at EU level in the course of 2017 
as the implementation of the European 
Agenda on Migration continued, includ-
ing activities related to the strengthen-
ing of the common asylum policy. At the 
end of 2017, negotiations were ongoing 
in the European Parliament and in the 
Council on the Commission’s proposals 
tabled in May and July 2016 for the reform 
of the Dublin Regulation, the Qualifica-
tions and Asylum Procedures Regulations 
and the Reception Conditions Directive, 
as well as on the proposal concerning the 
transformation of the European Asylum 
Support Office into the European Union 
Agency for Asylum.

5.7. Returns
In 2017, Member States reported 279 215 
return decisions issued to third-country 
nationals, which represented an 8.6 % 
decrease compared with 2016. The abso-
lute total number of migrants subject to 
return decisions is still underestimated 
by this indicator, as data on decisions 
were unavailable from Austria, France 
and the Netherlands. As in previous 
years, the number of return decisions 
was much larger than the total num-
ber of effective returns to third countries 
(151 398). The main reasons for non-re-
turn are related to practical problems in 
the identification of returnees and in ob-
taining necessary documentation from 
third-country authorities. In addition, 
many decisions to return voluntarily do 
not materialise as the persons decide to 
stay illegally. 
Some Member States reported that, 
over time, several return decisions have 
been issued to the same individuals. Al-
though it is not possible to quantify the 
phenomenon, as data at EU level are an-
onymised, it illustrates the difficulty to 
effectively implement a return decision. 
Other Member States report figures on 
effective returns that exceed the number 
of return decisions. This is primarily be-
cause some authorities are not fully re-
porting these decisions.
Finally, return decisions may also 
concern voluntary returns that are not 
registered. In fact, for voluntary return, 
only a few Member States apply a policy 
of controlled departure. Under these cir-
cumstances, it is difficult to ascertain 
that a return decision has effectively 
been implemented. 
Within the number of effective re-
turns to third countries, 50 % were re-
ported to be on a voluntary basis and 50 % 
were forced returns. In terms of nation-
alities, there is a striking difference be-
tween the nationalities detected crossing 
the border illegally or staying illegally in 
the EU, and those effectively returned. 
Indeed, many detections of illegal bor-
der-crossing or even detections of illegal 
stay concern migrants who will apply 
for asylum and thus are not returned 
before a possible negative asylum deci-
sion is issued. 
The Commission noted in its commu-
nication on return policy that data on 
basic parameters (such as the average 
length of detention, grounds for deten-
tion, number of failed returns, and use 
of entry bans) proved to be only availa-
ble from a limited number of Member 
States. Moreover, common definitions 
and approaches concerning data collec-
tion are frequently absent, impacting 
on the comparability of such data across 
the EU.
In 2017, the Agency assisted Member 
States in returning more than 14 000 
people whose asylum applications were 
rejected and who did not receive subsid-
iary protection status or were no longer 
eligible to remain in the EU. This was 
about a third more than the previous 
year and accounted for 9 % of the 151 398 
effective returns conducted by Member 
States. In addition, the Agency increased 
the number of Member States to which 
return specialists were deployed. 
Please note that the number of effective returns may sometimes be larger than return decisions, as a return decision issued in a given month may be effectively enforced at a later date. Also, return decisions may be issued 
without prejudice to the person’s right to apply for asylum. Readmissions between Member States are not included (for example between France and Italy). Effective returns do not necessarily mean returns to the country of 
origin and, for example in the case of Syrians, they include returns of persons to third countries considered to be safe (for example from Hungary to Serbia).

6.  Featured analyses
6.1.  Secondary movements in the EU
In 2017, many indicators of secondary ir-
regular migration seemed to be in signif-
icant decline after the migration crisis. 
In fact, the concerted effort of the coun-
tries along the Western Balkan route to 
control their borders and to end the facili-
tated crossing of their territories resulted 
in reducing the visible flow of people on 
the most frequently used secondary route 
through the former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia, Serbia, Croatia, Hungary 
and further on to Austria and Germany.
The effect of the migration 
crisis of 2015–2016 on secondary 
movements
However, detections reported from Mem-
ber States showed that these movements 
continued after March 2016 and through-
out 2017, although at lower levels and in 
a more covert way. In fact, the reinstate-
ment of controls at the internal borders 
of some Member States led to a diversi-
fication in routes and modi operandi. The 
detections of persons without valid docu-
ments reportedly travelling between EU/
Schengen countries decreased by around 
only 15 % between 2016 and 2017. How-
ever, the number of asylum applications 
of some of the most often detected na-
tionalities using these routes remained 
on a comparably high level. 
South-Eastern route: ongoing 
flows
In 2017, the level of intra-Schengen mi-
gration coming via the Eastern Mediter-
ranean and Western Balkan routes was 
much lower than in 2016 – even though 
secondary routes became more diverse. 
Asylum data from those Member 
States reached by migrants after hav-
ing crossed the Western Balkan coun-
tries, however, point to a continuing 
secondary flow through the region. Tak-
ing as an example Afghan, Iraqi and Pa-
kistani nationals, who primarily enter 
the EU from Turkey, significant discrep-
ancies can be found in the data: while 
in 2017, around 13 800 nationals of these 
three countries were detected crossing 
the Eastern Mediterranean illegally, and 
only around 8 700 the Western Balkan 
route, Member States reported to Euro-
stat around 78 000 asylum applications 
submitted by these three nationalities 
(from a total of around 117 000 applica-
tions and after excluding 39 175 multiple 
asylum applications derived from Mem-
ber States reporting on Eurodac hits).
Southern route: joint controls at 
a key location
In November 2017, the Austrian govern-
ment announced the start of checks for 
migrants hiding on freight trains near 
the Brenner Pass as part of the inception 
of trilateral controls between Austria, 
Germany and Italy. The reason for these 
measures was the repeated cases of irreg-
ular migrants risking their lives travel-
ling on cargo trains with the intention 
to reach Germany. The controls started 
on  the Italian side of the Brenner Pass. 
The number of detections of illegal 
stay of West African undocumented 
nationals, who mostly entered the EU 
through the Central Mediterranean, re-
mained on a similar level as in 2016, al-
though reported illegal border-crossings 
by West African nationals decreased by 
around one-third compared with 2016.
Substantial secondary flows 
from Italy to France
The number of irregular migrants de-
tected by France, who were identified 
to have previously applied for asylum 
or had been detected for illegal border-
crossing to Italy, substantially increased 
between 2016 and 2017, similar to the 
number of African nationals detected 
staying illegally in France. Apart from 
those African migrants applying for asy-
lum in France, many irregular migrants 
transited France with the intention to 
reach the United Kingdom.
EU-wide collection and 
harmonisation of information 
on secondary routes key to 
more targeted checks
Open sources and data reported by Mem-
ber States point to significant hidden ir-
regular migratory flows into and within 
the European Union / Schengen area. 
Targeted controls conducted on the ba-
sis of joint data collection and analysis 
would help to prevent migrants, espe-
cially those who travel hiding in lorries 
and trains, from using the dangerous 
and long secondary routes.

6.2. Returns, is the system effective?
The Malta Summit of 3 February 2017 
highlighted the need for a review of EU 
return policy in order to ensure the ef-
fective implementation of a sustainable 
migration policy throughout the EU. The 
renewed Action Plan on Return sets out 
steps at each stage of the return process 
to tackle key challenges for return – both 
at EU level and in the cooperation with 
countries of origin and transit. In March 
2017, the Commission put forward a con-
crete set of practical recommendations 
to Member States with a view to making 
return procedures more effective and im-
proving cooperation with countries of or-
igin on return and readmission, in line 
with fundamental rights requirements.
Frontex, the European Border and 
Coast Guard Agency, continues to sup-
port Member States in returning third-
country nationals who have been issued 
negative asylum decisions or who have 
no right to stay. In particular, the Agency 
coordinates and organises return oper-
ations and return interventions to re-
inforce the return systems of Member 
States. In 2017, the Agency supported 341 
return operations by charter flights, re-
turning 14 189 persons. Compared with 
2016, this was an increase of 47 % in the 
number of operations and an increase of 
32 % in the number of persons returned. 
Moreover, risk analysis by the Agency 
has been extended to include periodic 
return analysis.
As regards the cooperation with third 
countries, the focus is on improving 
structured practical cooperation. Hav-
ing concluded an agreement on Stand-
ard Operating Procedures on return with 
Bangladesh in September, the EU is now 
establishing structured practical coop-
eration with other key countries under 
this new approach.
Level of effective returns 
decreases to the lowest level 
since 2011
In 2017, the level of irregular migration 
significantly decreased, mirrored by the 
drop in the number of illegal border-
crossings (204 719) in comparison with 
the previous year. Concurrently, Mem-
ber States reported only 151 398 effective 
returns to third countries, 14 % less than 
in 2016, and the lowest figure since 2012.
When comparing these two indica-
tors, it should be taken into consider-
ation that a substantial share of those 
who crossed the border illegally have the 
right to be granted international protec-
tion and are not subjected to return. On 
the other hand, many returnees have en-
tered the EU abusing legal means, not 
by illegally crossing the external borders. 
Finally, examining irregular migration 
and returns, especially for a short refer-
ence period, does not take into account 
the period of time that usually lies be-
tween, on the one hand, arriving on EU 
territory, irregularly or by abusing legal 
means, and, on the other hand, the is-
suing of return decision and implement-
ing the effective return. 
Comparison between return 
decisions and effective returns 
reveals level of Member State 
capacities and international 
cooperation
The number of return decisions issued 
to third-country nationals dropped to 
279 215, which constitutes a drop of 9 % 
compared with the year before. In fact, 
a comparison between return decisions 
and effective returns uncovers clear dif-
ferences between the regions of origin. 
As regards Eastern European and Cen-
tral American nationals, the number 
of effective returns amounts to 74–84 % 
of the reported return decisions issued.
At the other end of the spectrum are 
the countries of Central and Eastern Af-
rica, where the number of effective re-
turns only represents around 15 % of the 
return decisions, followed by Western 
and Northern Africa with 24–34 %.

6.3. The role of border guards in countering terrorism
Evolving threats and challenges
Terrorism is a threat that transcends bor-
ders, a global challenge that requires con-
certed effort. Initially, the main conflict 
zones acted as areas of convergence. How-
ever, given the situation on the ground 
in a number of conflict zones – more spe-
cifically Daesh’s territorial losses in Iraq, 
Syria and Libya – the threat became more 
decentralised. It is therefore assessed 
that the challenges of detecting terrorist 
movements are diverse and in all travel 
directions – on exit/entry and in-transit.
While al-Qaeda focused on the ‘far en-
emy’ and ‘near enemy’ strategy, Daesh 
Caliphate doctrine was to ‘remain and ex-
pand’. The concept of expansion moved 
from endorsing the pledges of allegiance 
from regional provinces, known as 
wilayat, to the creation of areas of action.
Whether nourished by home-based 
extremism, by failed jihadists prevented 
from reaching a conflict area or muja-
hid returnees, the threat of inspired or 
directed terrorist attacks is likely to rise.
Travelling terrorists
In October 2017, the Soufan Center1 as-
sessed that of the over 40 000 foreign-
ers that joined Daesh from more than 
110 countries, around 5 600 from 33 dif-
ferent countries had returned home.
In July 2017, the Radicalisation Aware-
ness Network estimated that about 30 % 
of over 5 000 Foreign Terrorist Fighters 
(FTFs) who resided in Europe, and left 
to Syria, Iraq or Libya, came back to the 
continent. 
The focus should not just be on FTFs 
but also their support structures. The 
challenges are even more complicated 
when adding the hundreds of brides and 
children, in many cases widows and or-

phans. Data on FTFs are neither exhaus-
tive nor standardised. The infographics 
in Figures 6 and 7, offers a contextual 
understanding of the magnitude of the 
threat from Daesh’s global ranks and 
highlights the challenges that border 
guards and police authorities face in 
countering terrorism.
Women and minors
Islamist radicalisation is no longer a male 
dominated phenomenon. Under Daesh, 
women have taken on prominent roles, 
particularly in scouting for and encour-
aging other women to travel to the main 
areas of operations. Over the past years, 
the number of women leaving Europe 
on their own initiative in order to join 
the conflict zone and/or Daesh has in-
creased. Almost 1 000 women from Eu-
rope have joined the different jihadist 
groups in the Middle East, mainly Daesh. 
Furthermore, several hundred minors are 
also believed to have been brought to, or 
born in, the same region. It is particu-
larly difficult to assess the threat posed 
by women and children, who in many 
cases are now de facto widows and or-
phans, since their involvement in violent 
activities in Syria or Iraq often remains 
elusive. However, many women have 
expressed the desire to take more active 
roles within Daesh. The plot to attack the 
Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, planned 
by several females in September 2016, il-
lustrates this trend.

the potential identification of travelling 
terrorists or persons of interest. How-
ever, the green and blue borders pose 
many additional challenges, particu-
larly during large and sustained irreg-
ular migration movements.
While stressing that many migrants 
detected for illegal border-crossing are 
persons who are eligible for international 
protection, there are many challenges 
at the EU’s external borders in detect-
ing those linked to terrorism, crimes, or 
those suspected of war crimes.
Strengthening counter-
terrorism efforts
Borders provide challenges but also offer 
opportunities in better countering terror-
ism. The external border dimension is a 
geographical filter where Member States 
can take actions, enforce the rule of law 
and pursue prosecutorial or judicial ac-
tions. To this end, a number of legisla-
tive changes were made with the aim 
of deterring, disrupting, detecting and 
detaining terrorist related movements.
The European Border and Coast Guard 
Regulation underlines Frontex’s role in 
counter-terrorism. It states that due to 
its activities at the external borders, the 
Agency should contribute to the pre-
vention and detection of serious crimes 
with a cross-border dimension, includ-
ing terrorism.
Moreover, Article 8(1) states that the 
Agency shall, within the respective man-
dates of the agencies concerned, coop-
erate with Europol and Eurojust and 
provide support to Member States in cir-
cumstances requiring increased tech-
nical and operational assistance at the 
external borders in the fight against or-
ganised cross-border crime and terror-
ism. Furthermore, Article 40(8), states 
that Member States shall authorise and 
provide members of the European Bor-
der and Coast Guard teams with access to 
national and European databases which 
may be consulted. 
The amended mandate further ex-
pands the Agency’s supporting role to 
Member States’ counter-terrorism ef-
forts, which is already being done 
through screening, registration, doc-
ument checks or voluntary debriefing 
activities. All these activities converge 
on the main goal of supporting Member 
States in identifying potential travelling 
terrorists or persons of interest through 
detailed security checks.
Frontex is regularly providing data 
from its debriefing interviews to Eu-
ropol. The information packages with 
personal data transmitted to Europol 
are mainly in relation to migrant smug-
gling, but could possibly include infor-
mation on terrorists. 
Security checks
Checks at the external borders remain 
one of the main safeguards of the Schen-
gen area and significantly contribute 
to guaranteeing the long-term secu-
rity of the Union and its citizens. Such 
checks are carried out in the interest of 
all Member States. One of the purposes 
of these checks is to prevent any threat 
to the internal security of the Member 
States, irrespective of the origin of such 
threat – including potential threats posed 
by EU citizens.
The 2017 amendment of the Schen-
gen Borders Code reinforcing checks 
means that all persons crossing the Eu-
ropean Union’s external borders, both 
European Union citizens and third-coun-
try nationals, are now systematically 
checked against databases. Successful 
crosschecks in the Schengen Informa-
tion System rely on Member States pop-
ulating the database with relevant and 
actionable information. Furthermore, 
the global nature of the threat from ter-
rorism necessitates carrying out security 
checks also against non-European data 
banks including, when appropriate, In-
terpol’s databases.
On 8 June 2017, the Council of the 
European Union adopted conclusions 
recommending security checks in case 
of irregular migration. The Council re-
called that terrorists could exploit irreg-
ular migratory movements to enter into 
the European Union and highlighted the 
importance of setting up best practices 
in terms of security checks, also using 
biometric data, of irregular migrants.

6.4.  The impact of maritime cross-border crime to Europe
The Agency’s regulation, as amended 
in 2016, expanded the scope of risk as-
sessment – as an essential component 
of European Integrated Border Manage-
ment (IBM) – to encompass the analy-
sis of cross-border crimes. Cross-border 
crime is defined as ‘any serious crime 
with a cross-border dimension commit-
ted at or along, or which is related to, the 
external borders’. This brief overview de-
lineates the main challenges associated 
with cross-border crime from a border 
surveillance perspective. 
The Mediterranean Sea: drug 
trafficking cross-roads
It is estimated that approximately 125 
tonnes of cocaine worth EUR 27 billion 
are consumed in Europe each year. Large 
cocaine shipments are smuggled directly 
from Latin America to Europe through 
transatlantic routes within shipping 
containers and concealed compart-
ments of various types of vessels. In re-
cent years, cocaine smuggling networks 
have been diversifying the routes using 
transhipment hubs in West Africa (e.g. 
Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, The Gambia, 
Senegal, and Nigeria) and the Caribbean. 
Cocaine is moved by various transporta-
tion modes across North African coun-
tries to Europe. 
About 80 tonnes of Afghan heroin are 
smuggled to Western and Central Europe 
each year through the Islamic Republic 
of Iran, Turkey and South-Eastern Eu-
rope. Recent developments include the 
emergence of two new routes via the 
Southern Caucasus, and Syria and Iraq. 
However, the ‘Balkan route’ remains a 
key corridor for heroin entry into the 
EU. Albanian and Kosovo*-based crimi-
nal groups, among other Balkan groups, 
play a key role in the smuggling of her-
oin to Europe. Heroin is also smuggled 
from Afghanistan through the so-called 
‘southern route’ – a network of routes 
stretching from Afghanistan through 
Pakistan, the Persian Gulf and the In-
dian Ocean – to East Africa and then to 
Europe since criminal groups try to use 
alternative transhipment routes to min-
imise the risk of being intercepted by 
law enforcement. Developments on this 
route suggest a more significant role in 
the supply of European markets. 
Cannabis herb is produced in large 
quantities in South-Eastern Europe (es-
pecially Albania) and exported to West-
ern and Central Europe via the Adriatic 
Sea on speed boats and ferries from Al-
banian ports or land routes through 
neighbouring Balkan countries. Can-
nabis resin of Moroccan origin is smug-
gled to Western and Northern European 
markets by Moroccan drug trafficking 
groups in cooperation with international 
organised crime groups. Spain is the 
main entry point to Europe and the prin-
cipal smuggling method involves the 
use of speed boats. Significant quanti-
ties of Moroccan cannabis resin are also 
transported to North African countries, 
possibly for onward transportation to 
European markets. South-Eastern Eu-
rope also represents a secondary route 
for the smuggling of Moroccan canna-
bis resin to Europe. 
Cigarette smuggling not only at 
the land borders
Cigarette smuggling has been an im-
portant source of revenue for interna-
tional organised crime, but has also been 
linked to terrorist financing. According 
to OLAF, illicit tobacco seizures in Europe 
increased from 3.1 billion cigarettes in 
2013 to 3.8 billion in 2015. Even though 
approximately half of all cigarette sei-
zures occurred at eastern land borders, 
maritime-related smuggling activities 
and detections (i.e. in ports and sea ar-
eas) represent a significant share of the 
total, as cigarette smugglers routinely 
use all modes of transport. Their modi op-
erandi include, among others, smuggling 
via shipping containers with cover load 
documentation and exploitation of the 
limited oversight and simplified proce-
dures in free-trade zones (FTZ). Ciga-
rettes, apart form being illicitly imported 
into Europe, are also produced by clan-
destine factories located within Europe, 
which raw tobacco from Europe and over-
seas as a way to lower transportation 
costs and interception risks. Being a so-
phisticated form of crime, illicit tobacco 
trade is facilitated by price differentials 
between EU Member States and neigh-
bouring countries as well as corruption 
at EU borders.

Maritime routes for firearms 
trafficking
The illicit trade in firearms enables di-
verse organised crime and terrorist ac-
tivities. According to the findings of 
the European Commission funded Pro-
ject FIRE, the majority of firearm sei-
zures (i.e. pistols and rifles) in the period 
2010-2015 occurred in Western Europe 
(35 %), Southern Europe (26 %), North-
ern Europe (21 %) and Eastern Europe 
(18 %). The main destination countries 
were France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, 
Italy, the Netherlands, the Scandina-
vian countries, Spain, and the United 
Kingdom. Seizures mostly took place 
in the border areas (close to third coun-
tries with stockpiles), large ports and re-
gions with strong presence of organised 
crime groups. After the Cold War, many 
firearms were brought into Europe from 
former Soviet and Yugoslavian States as 
well as the Balkans. However, conflict ar-
eas near the EU (e.g. Ukraine, the Mid-
dle East and Libya) may open up new 
trafficking routes, including maritime 
ones. According to UNODC, small and 
large-scale firearms trafficking seems 
to mirror other known illicit trafficking 
patterns (e.g. drugs, contraband) that 
occur along land, sea or air routes. The 
recent case of the vessel ‘Andromeda’, 
flying the flag of Tanzania, which was 
seized in Greece for carrying 29 contain-
ers with explosives, highlights both the 
scale of activities and the dangers aris-
ing from this crime area.
Frontex-supported 
multipurpose maritime 
operations 
As can be seen in Table 1, in 2017 mar-
itime-related detections of narcotics in 
joint operations increased by 44 % over-
all in comparison to the previous year. 
In the same period, the number of de-
tections increased by 43 % and the num-
ber of arrested smugglers by 34 %. This 
significant increase was mainly due to 
numerous detections of cannabis herb 
(marijuana) and cannabis resin (hash-
ish) across operational areas. As regards 
detections of other narcotics, two ma-
jor seizures of cocaine were reported in 
2016 and 2017. Heroin detections, how-
ever, were less significant.
Other detected crimes in Frontex-
supported operations included ciga-
rette smuggling, weapons smuggling 
and stolen vehicles. The illicit smuggling 
of cigarettes occurs quite frequently in 
the main operational areas. As shown 
in Table 2 below, millions of pieces of 
smuggled cigarettes were seized in the 
Western, Central and Eastern Mediterra-
nean in 2017 marking an overall increase 
of 637 % compared with 2016. This sharp 
increase was associated with a number 
of major seizures that significantly in-
fluenced detection statistics. During the 
same period, the number of incidents 
rose by 24 % and the number of arrested 
smugglers by 65 %. 
Importantly, when comparing and in-
terpreting the achieved results it should 
be borne in mind that the JOs Triton and 
Poseidon are year-long operations whilst 
the JOs Indalo, Hera and Minerva last 
for a shorter period of time. Also, the 
reported detections – despite the multi-
purpose character of Frontex JOs – relate 
more to migrant smuggling (and search-
and-rescue activities) because of the mi-
gratory pressures in the Western, Central 
and Eastern Mediterranean. 
Improved operational responses 
in the maritime domain 
Organised crime groups flexibly exploit 
all maritime transportation modes to 
smuggle illicit commodities to European 
markets. The narcotics trade forms only 
a part of the whole picture of cross-bor-
der criminality, whose scope is broader 
including various illicit flows (e.g. coun-
terfeit products, cigarettes and fire-
arms), trafficking in human beings and 
terrorism. 
Criminal activities with the use of 
various types of vessels thrive in poorly 
controlled maritime areas within and be-
yond national jurisdictions – for exam-
ple, in the 200 nm exclusive economic 
zones (EEZ) and on the high seas. Fron-
tex-supported surveillance and multipur-
pose operations cover specific areas of the 
Mediterranean Sea helping to achieve 
significant results. Even so, the identi-
fied cross-border crimes represent a frac-
tion of the crimes that actually take place 
at the EU’s external maritime borders. 
The suppression of large-scale narcot-
ics and other sophisticated trafficking 
activities depends on intelligence-led 
criminal investigations. However, the 
number of detections of serious crimes 
during multipurpose operations can be 
improved through better risk assessment 
and targeting. For this reason, Fron-
tex will conduct thorough risk assess-
ments and deepen its cooperation with 
all stakeholders to improve operational 
responses.

6.5.  Debriefing interviews highlight 
key patterns
Since 2016, Frontex has been collect-
ing information from voluntary inter-
views (debriefings) with newly-arrived 
migrants in the Central, Eastern and 
Western Mediterranean Sea in the frame-
work of the Pilot Project PeDRA (Process-
ing Personal Data for Risk Analysis). In 
2017 (until the end of November), 3 525 
interviews with migrants from more 
than 70 countries were conducted upon 
their arrival in Italy, Greece and Spain 
by Frontex Guest Officers deployed from 
EU Member States. Of the total, 1 948 
interviews were conducted in the Cen-
tral Mediterranean, 991 in the Eastern 
Mediterranean and 586 in the Western 
Mediterranean. 
6.5.1. Analysis of migratory 
patterns
The sheer number of different nation-
alities provides evidence of the diverse 
origins of irregular migrants that con-
tribute to the phenomenon of mixed 
migration flows. The top five national-
ities of the whole sample were Syrians, 
Moroccans, Iraqis, Algerians and Suda-
nese. The most commonly interviewed 
migrants belonged to the age group 18– 
35 years old (86 %) and were unmarried 
(65 %) males (89 %) from African, Middle 
East and Asian countries – together ac-
counting for 60 % of interviews. 
As regards the education of inter-
viewed migrants, 13 % reported univer-
sity, 42 % secondary and 29 % primary 
level education – with only 5 % illiterate. 
More than half had secondary and uni-
versity level education – mainly migrants 
from Syria, Sudan, Iran, Afghanistan, 
Iraq, Pakistan, Morocco and Guinea. 
More than half of all interviewed mi-
grants travelled alone, with the remain-
der travelling as a group or with families. 
Some differences, however, were no-
ticed per smuggling route. Migrants in 
the Central and Western Mediterranean 
tended to travel alone (51 %) significantly 
more than those travelling via the East-
ern Mediterranean route (41 % alone and 
17 % as a group). The interviewed  mi-
grants travelling with family represented 
38 % in Eastern, 13 % in Central and only 
4 % in Western Mediterranean. This find-
ing carries important implications for 
the reception and accommodation of 
vulnerable groups (i.e. women, chil-
dren and elderly people), especially in 
the overcrowded reception facilities on 
the Hotspot islands of Greece, as well as 
the need to accelerate the processing of 
their asylum requests. 
In 2017,nearly all interviewed migrants 
claimed to have friends or relatives who 
are already in the EU, a trend similar to 
that observed in the previous year. This 
points to the role of already established 
diasporas in the EU that act as a pull fac-
tor for would-be migrants in source coun-
tries. In 2016, Italy was the most common 
final destination country, followed by 
Germany, France, Spain and the United 
Kingdom. In 2017, Italy, France, Ger-
many, Spain, Greece and United Kingdom 
were at the top of the list. This successive 
trend suggests that migrant preferences 
are asymmetrically distributed as they 
cluster around a small number of highly 
attractive final destination countries. This 
represents a stable trend observed at least 
over the last two years. 
Certain nationalities demonstrated 
patterned responses regarding their fi-
nal destination countries. For example, 
many Eritreans showed a preference for 
the United Kingdom, Germany and It-
aly; Gambians for Italy and Germany; 
Moroccans for Spain, Italy and France; 
Nigerians for Italy; and, Syrians for 
Germany. The great variation of source 
countries and the clustering of migrant 
preferences towards a small number of 
prime destination countries shape the 
pattern of irregular migration towards 
the EU and the subsequent secondary 
movements. 
Furthermore, out of the sample, 
among the push and pull factors, 45 % 
of the interviewed migrants mentioned 
economic reasons. The poor economic 
situation in their countries of origin to-
gether with the economic / work-related 
opportunities in destination countries 
were quoted as the principal reasons be-
hind their decision to migrate to affluent 
European countries. For approximately 
16 % of migrants, conflict in their home 
country together with the asylum policy 
in receiving countries were the second 
most important reasons for migration. 
However, differences per migra-
tion route were found within the sam-
ple. Positively-aligned economic (push-
pull) reasons were mentioned by 58 % 
of interviewed migrants in the West-
ern Mediterranean, 45 % in the Central 
Medi terranean and only 15 % in the East-
ern Mediterranean. Specifically, in the 
Eastern Mediterranean the pattern was 
largely reversed with 68 % of migrants cit-
ing push factors (i.e. conflict, extreme 
religious activity and national service) 
as the main reasons for leaving their 
countries. Since the interviewed mi-
grants along this migratory route re-
ferred to a variety of pull factors (includ-
ing economic ones), the push and pull 
factors were not aligned to a consider-
able degree revealing complex reasons 
behind their decision to migrate to Eu-
rope. Conversely, many of those travel-
ling via the Eastern Mediterranean route 
are in mentioned the need of interna-
tional protection.
•  Almost half of all interviewed mi-
grants stated economic push-pull 
factors for migration.
•  The preferences of migrants from 
numerous source countries con-
verged on a small number of highly 
attractive final destination coun-
tries in the EU.
•  The significant number of migrants 
travelling with family via the East-
ern Mediterranean poses particu-
lar challenges for the reception and 
asylum system of Greece.

Frontex · Risk Analysis for 2018
6.5.2. Analysis of smuggling 
patterns 
•  Migratory movements through 
neighbouring third countries – es-
pecially, Turkey and Libya – to Eu-
rope depend to a large extent on the 
availability of smuggling services.
•  The maritime specialisation of 
migrant smugglers requires par-
ticular attention by border police 
authorities.
•  Both in terms of demand and sup-
ply, the facilitation business in Tur-
key and Libya has assumed a truly 
international character transform-
ing these countries into major mi-
gration hubs.
Significantly, 88 % of all interviewed 
migrants reported that they had been 
facilitated to complete their irregular 
journeys. Most migrants in the Eastern 
Mediterranean (92 %) and in the Central 
Mediterranean (90 %) were facilitated, 
whereas the share of facilitated migrants 
in the Western Mediterranean stood 
fairly lower (75 %). Despite several push-
pull factors that could influence the se-
lection of smuggling route, facilitation 
was perceived as the most important var-
iable by 69 % of interviewed migrants in 
the Eastern Mediterranean and 65 % in 
the Central Mediterranean. In the West-
ern Mediterranean, however, facilitation 
was seen as the most important factor by 
only 38 % of migrants. This significant 
difference was due to the higher impor-
tance migrants assigned to the aspects of 
safety, price, border topography and low 
risk of detection. Overall, the fact that 
the majority of newly-arrived migrants 
through the main three migration corri-
dors turned to the services of facilitators 
to enter the EU illegally proves the crucial 
role of smuggling markets and networks 
in driving irregular migration to Europe. 
In addition, the analysis of migrant 
interviews highlighted the most im-
portant facilitator roles. Namely, the 
‘bosses’, who run smuggling groups and 
control specific areas of operations, and 
their recruiters (or agents), who find mi-
grants wishing to be smuggled across 
to Europe. The second most important 
roles were those of safe house manag-
ers (or owners) and middlemen (or bro-
kers). Other distinct roles such as boat 
operators, drivers, document forgers, 
money collectors and security providers 
were mentioned by migrants to a lesser 
extent. Most likely, this suggests that 
the latter roles are instrumental but less 
important. So, based on migrants’ an-
swers, the people smuggling business is 
mainly organised by various ‘bosses’ and 
their recruiters. This finding could help 
focus police work on the key cooperation 
between ‘bosses’ and their agents with 
the aim of targeting them and eventu-
ally disrupting the business model of 
migrant smuggling.
The majority of interviewed migrants 
(85 %) travelled by boat to various arrival 
points in Spain, Italy and Greece. Since 
maritime transportation is the principal 
smuggling method, it implies that the 
ability to organise sea journeys is a key 
attribute of the smuggler profile. For this 
reason, increased focus on smugglers’ 
maritime specialisation could assist in-
telligence and law enforcement efforts.
According to migrants’ answers, peo-
ple smugglers of 55 different nationali-
ties were involved in the facilitation of 
irregular migration towards Libya, Tur-
key and Spain and onwards to the EU. 
Reportedly, the facilitators were active 
in 41 different countries, which suggests 
the international scope and reach of their 
activities. The top ranking nationalities 
of facilitators were Libyan, Syrian, Iraqi, 
Turkish and Afghan. Importantly, how-
ever, the vast majority of facilitators op-
erated mainly in two countries – Turkey 
(37 %) and Libya (30 %). Other countries 
with significant presence of facilitators 
were: Iraq, Morocco, Syria, Iran, Sudan, 
Algeria and Egypt – together accounting 
for 30 % of the total. The concentration 
of diverse nationalities of facilitators in 
Turkey and Libya denotes the importance 
of these two countries as major regional 
hubs for irregular migration into Europe. 
Further analysis of the relationship 
between smuggler and migrant na-
tionality identified a significant non-
matching pattern between Turkish and 
Libyan facilitators and the nationalities 
of migrants facilitated by them. In other 
words, Turkish (100 %) and Libyan (93 %) 
facilitators tended to smuggle differ-
ent nationalities of migrants to Europe 
(as opposed to smuggling their compa-
triots). Turkish facilitators smuggled 
Syrian, Iraqi, Iranian, Afghan, Pales-
tinian and Pakistani migrants. Libyan 
facilitators smuggled Moroccan, Syr-
ian, Sudanese, Egyptian, Tunisian and 
Ethiopian migrants. To a smaller extent, 
other non-matching patterns involved 
Algerian, Egyptian, Eritrean, Ethiopian, 
Senegalese and Sudanese facilitators who 
smuggled different migrant nationalities 
more often than their fellow nationals. 
Conversely, a significant matching 
pattern was noticed regarding Iraqi 
and Syrian facilitators. This means 
that Iraqi (88 %) and Syrian (62 %) facil-
itators tended to smuggle their fellow 
nationals a lot more than different na-
tionalities of migrants. To a smaller ex-
tent, other facilitators who tended to 
smuggle their compatriots more often 
than other nationalities of migrants in-
volved Afghan, Bangladeshi, Cameroo-
nian (100 %), Congolese, Moroccan and 
Pakistani nationals. Besides smuggling 
their compatriots, Iraqi facilitators also 
smuggled Syrian and Iranian migrants, 
whereas Syrian facilitators smuggled 
Iraqi, Palestinian, Moroccan and Egyp-
tian migrants.

6.6.  Trafficking in human beings:  
vulnerabilities at the external borders
Trafficking in human beings (THB) is 
currently one of the most profitable 
forms of organised crime, generating 
billions of euros for traffickers. Europe, 
which comprises some of the wealthiest 
nations in the world, has long been an 
important market for the exploitation 
of victims, particularly through sexual 
exploitation, forced labour, exploitation 
of criminal activities, begging and ille-
gal adoption. The high levels of supply 
in origin countries, coupled with the de-
mand for cheap labour and sexual ser-
vices in the destination countries, are 
among the most common root causes 
of human trafficking. 
The secretive nature of THB and dif-
ferences between Member States’ victim 
identification procedures makes it diffi-
cult to gauge the full extent of this crime 
and arrive at precise figures regarding 
the total number of victims in the EU. 
However, data collection efforts at EU 
level has put the number of registered 
victims (both identified and presumed) 
at 15 846 for 2013 and 2014, a number be-
lieved to be significantly higher. 
The present analysis aims to shed 
light on some of the main issues affect-
ing the EU’s external borders, which re-
quire special attention from border and 
coast guards: THB from Africa – particu-
larly from Nigeria – and unaccompanied 
and separated children. 
Trafficking in human beings 
from Africa 
Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly coun-
tries in West Africa, currently represents 
one of the main source regions of victims 
of human trafficking in the EU. The vic-
tims are mainly from poverty-stricken ar-
eas where high levels of unemployment, 
deprivation, illiteracy and gender ine-
quality prevail, factors that often boost 
their desire to travel abroad in search of 
new opportunities. They come in large 
numbers from Nigeria, but also from 
such countries as Cameroon, Ghana, 
Guinea, Côte d’Ivoire and Sierra Leone. 
Trafficking in human beings, from 
Nigeria in particular, has in the past few 
years become of particular concern to 
law enforcement authorities across the 
EU. Although human trafficking from 
Nigeria has, for decades, supplied the 
European sex market, the spike in the 
number of Nigerian females arriving in 
mixed migration flows to Italy (and, to 
a lesser extent, Spain), has brought the 
phenomenon of THB from Nigeria to 
light. Currently, Nigeria represents the 
top nationality of third-country victims 
of THB in the EU. 
The Nigerian victims are mostly 
women and increasingly younger girls, 
many of whom are minors. The great ma-
jority originates from states in southern 
Nigeria, particularly Edo, Ogun, Osun, 
Lagos, Anambra, Enugu, Imo, Rivers, 
Cross-River, Delta and Akwa Ibom. The 
victims are recruited from poor commu-
nities where families struggle to survive 
economically. They are often approached 
by former prostitutes turned traffickers 
or people working on their behalf with 
offers of well-paid jobs or studies in Eu-
ropean countries. The future, however, 
turns out to be much grimmer for the 
many women and girls who embark on 
the journey to Europe. 
Before departing from Nigeria, the 
victims are often subjected to a humili-
ating and daunting voodoo ritual (named 
juju), during which their nail clippings, 
pubic hair or menstrual blood and items 
of clothing are taken and placed in a 
packet kept by the juju priest. The ritual 
aims to instil fear in the victims and en-
sure that they will pay their debt to the 
traffickers upon arrival in Europe and re-
frain from collaborating with authorities 
in the destination country or share infor-
mation that could identify their traffick-
ers. The fear of the juju, which victims 
believe may cause death to them or their 
families in case they break the oath, has 
become a very effective method of re-
straint and psychological control over 
victims, and an important tool to ensure 
compliance and payment of the debt. 
From Nigeria, the victims travel over-
land to Libya or Morocco through the city 
of Agadez in Niger. Many are subjected 
The greatest share of identified vic-
tims are trafficked into the EU for the 
purpose of sexual exploitation. Ac-
cording to UNODC, 67 % of the 12 775 
victims detected in Western and 
Southern Europe between 2012 and 
2014, whose form of exploitation was 
reported, were trafficked for this pur-
pose. Likewise, in Central and South-
Eastern Europe, more than two thirds 
of the 6 870 victims detected were sub-
jected to sexual exploitation. How-
ever, the number of identified victims 
of THB for labour exploitation has 
also increased over the past few years, 
leading to some Member States re-
cording a higher number of victims 
of THB for labour exploitation than 
any other type of exploitation. 
Child trafficking has also gained 
significant prominence in the EU in 
the past few years, as the number of 
registered child victims increases. In-
deed, in the period 2013–2014, around 
15 % of the registered victims of THB 
were children. 
Besides domestic, short-distance 
and medium-distance trafficking, the 
EU is affected by long-distance traf-
ficking, with victims coming from 
countries in Africa, Asia and South 
America. Approximately 29 % of vic-
tims of human trafficking in the EU 
are believed to originate from Third 
Countries, with the biggest share 
of victims coming from the African 
continent.

to violence and exploitation on the way 
to Europe, as they are placed in connec-
tion houses where they are isolated from 
the external world, raped and forced into 
prostitution. Others still are sold to dif-
ferent traffickers during the journey, 
changing hands like a commodity. Once 
in Europe, the victims are usually placed 
in open reception centres where they 
are picked up by the traffickers soon af-
ter their arrival. 
The great majority of the victims who 
make it across the Mediterranean end 
up working as prostitutes in the streets 
of Europe to pay their traffickers an ex-
cessively high debt – that can at times 
amount to up to EUR 50 000. After they 
pay off of their debt, some will turn into 
madams, recruiting new victims to sup-
port the criminal organisation that ex-
ploited them for years.
Separated and unaccompanied 
children
Globally, children comprise the second-
most prevalent group of victims of hu-
man trafficking after women. Over the 
period of 2012–2014, child victims rep-
resented around 25 % to 30 % of the total 
number of victims of THB.1 The EU in 
particular, has witnessed an increase in 
the number of registered cases of child 
trafficking in the past few years. Avail-
able statistics on this phenomenon in-
dicate that in the period 2013–2014, of a 
total number of 15 846 victims registered 
1 United Nations Office on Drugs 
and Crime (2016). Global Report on 
Trafficking in persons, p.25
in the EU, 2 375 were children.2 The phe-
nomenon of child trafficking has been 
exacerbated by the ongoing migration 
crisis. Of particular concern are third-
country children who arrive in the EU 
within the migratory flow unaccompa-
nied or separated from their family; their 
number has increased exponentially in 
recent years. Most of these children are 
fleeing war and conflict, poverty, natu-
ral disasters, forced marriage and con-
scription, and travel to the EU to seek 
refuge and a better life. 
The Central Mediterranean and, prior 
to the EU-Turkey agreement on resettle-
ment of refugees signed in March 2016, 
the Eastern Mediterranean routes have 
served as main entry points for unaccom-
panied and separated children looking 
to come to the EU. In early 2016, around 
40 % of the total number of migrants ar-
riving in Greece by sea were children 
(a figure that comprises both accompa-
nied and unaccompanied children). In 
the Central Mediterranean this figure 
proved even higher, with 92 % of all chil-
dren arriving in Italy by sea in 2016 and 
the first two months of 2017 believed to 
be unaccompanied.3 Despite these esti-
mations, the total number of children 
arriving unaccompanied in the EU is 
difficult to gauge.
Upon arrival in Europe, these children 
become the perfect target for unscrupu-
lous traffickers, as their young age, inex-
perience, naivety and desire to start work 
or studies, makes them more vulnerable 
and easily manipulated, exposing them 
to a severe risk of THB and subsequent

exploitation. Migration camps and re-
ception centres set up in the EU to ac-
commodate newly-arrived migrants may 
increase the vulnerability of already at-
risk children, particularly where the cen-
tres lack adequate conditions (i.e. weak 
or non-existent protective structures) or 
the children share overcrowded facilities 
with adults not related or unknown to 
them. Traffickers are known to operate 
outside reception centres, picking up 
their victims upon arrival in Europe. 
This phenomenon is particularly preva-
lent in the trafficking of Nigerian girls, 
who frequently claim to be older at ar-
rival, so as to be placed in open reception 
centres alongside other migrants, from 
where it is easier to escape. 
The alarming scale of human traffick-
ing from African countries, particularly 
Nigeria, and the arrival of unaccompa-
nied or separated children who may be 
at risk of THB, brings to light the vital 
role of border guards in the fight against 
human trafficking. Border guards may 
sometimes represent the only oppor-
tunity for victims to get support and 
protection from exploitation. It is there-
fore paramount that border guards are 
trained and properly equipped with the 
knowledge and resources that enable a 
swift and early identification of potential 
victims upon arrival, so as to ensure that 
the right referral and protection mecha-
nisms are activated, adequate treatment 
and assistance provided and the risks of 
trafficking and future exploitation mit-
igated. Children and women represent 
some of the most vulnerable groups and 
their protection should be a top priority 
in Europe.

7. Outlook 
Based on the description of the situation 
in 2017, this chapter reviews the possi-
ble evolution of the situation along the 
external borders of the EU in the com-
ing years. While some developments are 
likely to materialise, others seem possi-
ble, based on current knowledge. Past 
experiences demonstrate that there are 
a large number of unforeseeable events 
and factors that can have a profound 
and unpredictable impact on the situa-
tion at the border. 
The likely
Continued pressure in the southern 
area
Considering the remaining large pool of 
migrants stranded in Libya, in the im-
mediate future (2018), developments in 
that area will be most decisive for the 
overall number of arrivals at the EU’s 
external borders, assuming that the EU-
Turkey statement holds.
On the Eastern Mediterranean 
route, the increased number of ille-
gal border-crossings in the latter half 
of 2017 was a reflection of the overall 
number of attempts to cross the Eastern 
Aegean rather than a declining com-
mitment to prevent departures by the 
Turkish authorities. 
On the Western Balkan route, Serbia’s 
visa liberalisation for Chinese, Indian 
and Iranian citizens, granted in Septem-
ber 2017, has started to show an impact. 
The numbers of migrants claiming to be 
citizens of these countries detected for 
illegal border-crossing and fraudulent 
use of documents at the EU’s external 
borders are already rising. 
The increase in the number of citizens 
of Mali and Côte d’Ivoire on the Western 
Mediterranean may be the precursor of 
an even larger pressure on the Western 
Mediterranean route.
Increased share of Africans
The share of African migrants, and in 
particular West African migrants, de-
tected crossing the border illegally is 
likely to grow. 
Increased passenger flows and 
responsibilities
Regular passenger flows across the exter-
nal border will increase significantly due 
to rising global mobility. Border-control 
authorities will have to take on more re-
sponsibilities as a result of introducing 
visa liberalisation processes, local bor-
der traffic agreements and systematic 
checks of all passengers. Border man-
agement will increasingly be risk-based 
to ensure that interventions are focused 
on the movements of high-risk individ-
uals, while low-risk movements are fa-
cilitated smoothly. 
The air travel environment is becom-
ing more complex with the growth of 
low-cost carriers. In addition, advances 
in travel complexity and increasing so-
phistication of criminal activities result 
in increasing workload for border-con-
trol officers. 
Given the increasing level of security 
features in modern travel documents and 
stricter migration policies across Member 
States, the misuse of genuine travel doc-
uments (which includes impersonation 
38 of 54
Frontex · Risk Analysis for 2018
and fraudulently obtained documents) 
is likely to be an entry method that will 
become more widespread.
The possible
Increasing complexity
In the Mediterranean, the increasing 
complexity of irregular arrivals is ex-
pected to absorb significant resources. 
The vast surveillance area, along with the 
increasing trend in boats seeking assis-
tance, results in border assets being in-
creasingly mobilised in support of search 
and rescue activities. 
In addition, as a consequence of in-
creased surveillance, border – control 
authorities are often among the first 
authorities to detect a wide range of il-
legal activities. This implies develop-
ing synergies with other EU activities in 
the maritime domain in general, such 
as other actors present at sea or the EU 
Delegations (through development pro-
grammes but also with their counter-ter-
rorism experts).
Increasing arrivals of vulnerable 
people (women, children, persons 
fleeing conflicts)
Increasingly, border-control authorities 
need to be prepared to manage the flow 
of vulnerable people, including numer-
ous children. This makes it necessary to 
focus on further development of specific 
mechanisms and procedures to meet the 
needs of this vulnerable group at the EU’s 
external borders, including all air, land 
and sea borders. 
Change in modus operandi, including 
non-detection
Swift diversification of modi operandi, dis-
placement between routes or border 
types, and attempts to evade detection 
or identification are all possible to occur 
in response to enhanced surveillance and 
migration control. While until recently, 
migrants detected at the border could 
swiftly continue unhindered to their final 
destinations, the emerging pattern is that 
migrants who go undetected can arrive at 
their destination quickly; it also means 
that they do not have to bear the conse-
quences of being detected for illegal stay 
or being refused asylum. The number pro-
portion of migrants undertaking second-
ary movements is also expected to rise. 
Transit through Turkey and 
the Western Balkans
In addition, an increasing number of mi-
grants from North Africa and the Middle 
East are expected to transit to Turkey via 
the air border, before attempting to cross 
illegally the border to the EU, also by us-
ing forged documents. Istanbul Atatürk 
Airport is an important hub for irregu-
lar migrants travelling by air to several 
Member States.
The Western Balkans geographical 
location makes it an important tran-
sit area for irregular migrants en route 
from Turkey towards Western Europe. 
In addition, Serbia now offers visa-free 
travel options to new third countries that 
makes it more attractive for migrants to 
reach the EU. 
Underlying threat of terrorism
Overall, there is an underlying threat of 
terrorism-related movements. Conflict 
zones like Syria, Iraq and Libya have at-
tracted thou sands of foreign terrorist 
fighters, including EU citizens, dual-na-
tionality holders and other third-coun-
try nationals. Given the loss of ground 
Islamist extremists suffered in a number 
of conflict zones, the threat has evolved 
into a more decentralised reality that in-
creases the risk of terrorists’ movements.
The risk that terrorists cross the bor-
der illegally remains. Moreover, docu-
ment fraud – including the misuse of 
fraudulently obtained documents and/or 
genuine documents used by impostors – 
is to be increasingly expected.
The unknown
Unforeseen events can play a big role in 
shaping migration flows. It is safe to as-
sume that unpredictable developments 
will, again, influence the situation at 
the external borders. 
Political developments, the level of co-
operation with third countries, changes 
in Libya are hard to predict. What is vis-
ible, however, is that a great number of 
people are being displaced. According 
to UNHCR, in 2016, 65.6 million people 
were forcibly displaced worldwide. Most 
of them are from and stay in developing 
countries, and only a fraction decide to 
move to the EU. Yet, this small number 
may have sizeable impact on the EU’s 
borders and their management. The size 
and composition of the flows are inher-
ent to the appearance and development 
of crises, hence the importance of ob-
taining information from a wide range 
of countries and sources, developing ca-
pabilities to monitor the flows and un-
derstanding their drivers. 
Threats at the borders may also take 
non-conventional forms, some physical 
such as terrorism, others are more sub-
tle, like misinformation campaign and 
media manipulation to undermine core 
European values. Emerging powers can 
use migration to instrumentalise mi-
gration flows, or use the complexity of 
migratory movements as a pretext for 
concessions. These ‘hybrid threats’ com-
bine the interconnected nature of chal-
lenges (terrorism, migration), with the 
multiplicity of actors involved (regular 
forces, criminal groups) and the diversity 
of means (diplomatic, technological). As 
such they are particularly difficult to an-
ticipate and require comprehensive ap-
proaches aimed at managing the risks 
they pose.

8.  Conclusions
41 of 54
Frontex · Risk Analysis for 2018
The rise in detections on the Western 
Mediterranean stands out against the 
overall decrease in detections of illegal 
border-crossing and suggests that the 
actual pressure exerted on the exter-
nal borders stays high. Geopolitical and 
economic drivers of migration are on the 
rise and the EU remains exposed to large 
migration flows.
Irregular migration by sea, and 
more specifically via the Mediterranean 
routes, will remain the main modus op-
erandi for illegally crossing the EU’s ex-
ternal borders and also one of the most 
dangerous forms of migrant smuggling 
and one which often requires humani-
tarian assistance efforts. To tackle this 
phenomenon, cooperation among mar-
itime security players and shared use of 
assets are gaining momentum. Border 
control authorities are increasingly 
confronted with the detection of cross-
border crimes such as drug trafficking 
and the smuggling of excise goods, but 
also pollution and fisheries issues. While 
the synergies created offer opportunities, 
they also require adapting and scaling 
up of border control resources.
In 2017, great strides were made in 
achieving the goal of uniform registration 
of irregular migrants crossing the EU’s 
external borders due to the continued 
implementation of the Hotspot concept.
The alarming scale of human traffick-
ing from African countries, particularly 
Nigeria, and the arrival of unaccompa-
nied or separated children who may be at 
risk of THB, bring to light the vital role 
of border and coast guards in the iden-
tification of potential victims of human 
trafficking. Border guards may some-
times represent the only opportunity 
for victims to receive support and pro-
tection from exploitation. 
There are signs that migrants rapidly 
exchange information about travelling 
routes and crossing borders to circum-
vent migration control. Migrants are 
becoming more autonomous, sustain-
ing themselves while on the move and 
passing information back to other mi-
grants, as well as relying on local crim-
inal structures for crossing borders.
In turn, document fraud, apart from 
being an essential element of criminal 
activities such as  trafficking in hu-
man beings and migrant smuggling, 
has also been increasingly associated 
with terrorist threat. The introduc-
tion of sophisticated security features 
in travel documents has pushed users 
of fraudulent documents to develop new 
techniques and target other types of doc-
uments used to support applications for 
genuine travel documents, making it 
more difficult to detect fraud. 
Border-control authorities put the 
majority of their efforts into conduct-
ing entry and exit checks. This obligation 
increased significantly in 2017 with the 
demand to carry out systematic checks 
against relevant databases on all per-
sons, including EU citizens. While this 
has significantly impacted the work of 
border guards, so have the ever-increas-
ing passenger flows, which continue to 
be driven by visa liberalisation and local 
border traffic agreements as well as ever-
increasing passenger numbers. These are 
most visible at the air borders as a result 
of increased mobility and the rapid ex-
pansion of the supply of more afforda-
ble flight options.
Relations with the border control 
authorities of third countries focusing 
on border security issues most relevant 
to them is matter requiring attention. 
In building relations with third coun-
tries, consideration should be given to 
the EU’s political priorities and the core 
values on which the EU is based in a rap-
idly changing security environment, 
both internally and externally.
Effective returns are increasing at 
a slower pace than return decisions, 
a trend that reveals the difficulty Mem-
ber States experience in enforcing re-
turns. The extent of return cooperation, 
the effectiveness of readmission agree-
ments and Member States capacities in 
returns are likely to continue having sub-
stantial impact on the size and routes of 
irregular migration flows.

Notes on FRAN data sources and methods 
For the data concerning detections at 
the external borders, some of the bor-
der types are not applicable to all FRAN 
Member States. This pertains to data 
concerning all FRAN indicators since 
the data are provided disaggregated by 
border type. The definitions of detec-
tions at land borders are therefore not 
applicable (excluding borders with non-
Schengen principalities) for Belgium, 
the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, 
Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Lux-
embourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Por-
tugal, Sweden, Switzerland and the 
United Kingdom. For Cyprus, the land 
border refers to the Green Line demar-
cation with the area not under the ef-
fective control of the government of the 
Republic of Cyprus. For sea borders, the 
definitions are not applicable for land-
locked countries including Austria, the 
Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg, 
Slovakia and Switzerland.
In addition, data on detections of il-
legal border-crossing at land, air and 
sea BCPs (1B) are not available for Ice-
land, Ireland and Spain. Data for Nor-
way only includes detections of illegal 
border-crossing at land and sea BCPs 
(1B), not between BCPs (1A).
Data on detections of illegal border-
crossing between sea BCPs (1A) are not 
available for Ireland. Data concerning 
the apprehension (FRAN Indicator 2) of 
facilitators is not available for Ireland. 
For Italy, the data are not disaggregated 
by border type, but are reported as total 
apprehensions (not specified).
Data for Italy and Norway also include 
the facilitation of illegal stay and work. 
For Romania, the data include land in-
tra-EU detections on exit at the border 
with Hungary.
For the data concerning detections of 
illegal stay (FRAN Indicator 3), data con-
cerning detections on exit are not avail-
able for Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Spain 
and the United Kingdom.
Data on refusals of entry (FRAN In-
dicator 4) at the external EU borders are 
not disaggregated by reason of refusal 
for Ireland and the United Kingdom.
The data on return decisions issued 
(FRAN Indicator 7A) are not available for 
France, the Netherlands and Austria. 
The data on effective returns (FRAN In-
dicator 7B) are not available for Austria 
since 2016. In addition, the data of ef-
fective returns are not disaggregated by 
return operation (voluntary and forced) 
for Spain. The data on voluntary effec-
tive returns (FRAN Indicator 7A) are not 
disaggregated by type of return opera-
tion (IOM-assisted and others) for Bel-
gium, the Czech Republic, Finland and 
the Netherlands. The data on forced ef-
fective returns (FRAN Indicator 7B) are 
not disaggregated by type of return oper-
ation (enforced by Member States and by 
Joint Operations) for Belgium, Finland, 
Iceland and the Netherlands.
The data on passenger flow are not 
available for Austria, Ireland, Sweden, 
the UK and Portugal (since June 2016). 
Data on passenger flow at the air bor-
der are not available according to the 
definition for Spain. Data at the sea bor-
der are not available for Cyprus, Malta, 
Spain, the Netherlands, Romania and 
Denmark. 
For all indicators, data from Croatia 
are available only starting with July 2013.
