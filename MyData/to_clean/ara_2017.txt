Risk Analysis for 2017
Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training, operations and research, 
each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis publications bear a triangular symbol formed 
by an arrow drawing a triangle, with a dot at the centre. Meta phorically, the arrow represents the cyclical 
nature of risk analysis processes and its orienta tion towards an appropriate operational response. The tri­
angle is a symbol of ideal proportions and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit of factual exactness, truth and 
exhaustive analysis. The dot at the centre represents the intelligence factor and the focal point where informa­
tion from diverse sources converges to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical products. Thus, 
Frontex risk analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable ba sis for its operational activities.

1. Preface
In 2016, the EU experienced another year 
of intense migratory pressure at its ex­
ternal borders. Member States reported 
more than 511 000 detections of illegal 
border­crossing, which corresponds to 
roughly 382 000 new arrivals from Af­
rica, the Middle East and Asia. This was a 
significant decrease in comparison with 
2015, when over one million migrants 
came to the EU. However, the overall 
situation at Europe’s external borders 
remained challenging. 
The decrease in arrivals was mainly 
caused by fewer migrants arriving in 
Greece from Turkey. This drop was a re­
sult of the EU­Turkey statement of March 
2016 and the introduction of strict bor­
der­control measures in Western Bal­
kan countries, which effectively closed 
the Balkan route. 
As a result of the EU­Turkey state­
ment, migrants who arrived on the 
Greek Islands after 20 March could be 
returned to Turkey. Indeed, since April 
2016 Frontex supported the Greek au­
thorities in returning migrants who had 
been issued return decisions.
While the number of migrants from 
Asia and the Middle East decreased, 2016 
was marked with an increase in migra­
tory pressure from Africa, in particular 
on the route from Libya to Italy. Italy saw 
the highest number of arrivals ever re­
corded – about 182 000, with a signifi­
cant increase in the number of migrants 
from West Africa. Tragically, despite res­
cue efforts by Frontex, the Italian Coast 
Guard and Navy, Operation EUNAVFOR 
Med, and the assistance of many NGO 
and commercial vessels, several thou­
sands of migrants making the cross­
ing on overcrowded and unseaworthy 
rubber dinghies lost their lives in the 
Mediterranean. 
There was also an increase in peo­
ple­smuggling activities, both on routes 
leading to and within Europe. Many of 
the migrants used forged documents, 
which remains a challenge for border 
authorities. Moreover, a large number 
of poorly documented migrants moving 
within Europe continues to constitute 
a threat to Europe’s internal security. 
Throughout the year, Frontex (since 
October 2016 the European Border and 
Coast Guard Agency) consistently de­
ployed between 1 000 and 1 500 border 
guards at the EU’s external borders. In 
its maritime operations in the Central 
Mediterranean and the Aegean Sea, the 
Agency­deployed vessels rescued 90 000 
migrants. At the same time, Frontex of­
ficers ensured the registration and iden­
tification of thousands of newly­arrived 
migrants in Greece and Italy. In Frontex 
operations in Italy, Greece, Spain, Hun­
gary, Croatia and Bulgaria, 1 265 sus­
pected people smugglers were arrested 
and more than 95 tonnes of illegal nar­
cotics confiscated.
In December 2015, the European Com­
mission proposed the creation of a Eu­
ropean Border and Coast Guard. The 
proposal was endorsed by the Member 
States and the European Parliament, and 
on 6 October 2016 the European Border 
and Coast Guard Agency was launched.

The Agency, built on the foundations of 
Frontex, with increased budget and, in 
the near future, with significantly more 
staff, is entrusted with more responsibil­
ities in the field of migration but also in­
ternal security. The European Border and 
Coast Guard Agency is building the ca­
pacity to deploy border and coast guard 
forces rapidly and efficiently, to support 
return measures, and to collect and pro­
cess personal data. All of these efforts 
support Europe’s migration management 
process and foster closer cooperation with 
key non­EU countries in areas related to 
migration. These measures have a sin­
gle aim of preserving the free movement 
within the Schengen area. 
As part of its new mandate, Fron­
tex created a rapid deployment pool in 
2016. These 1 500 officers can now be dis­
patched by the Agency to border areas 
in need of urgent assistance. In its new 
role regarding coast guard functions, 
Frontex also increased cooperation with 
other European maritime agencies. In 
addition to its core tasks of border con­
trol and management, the Agency initi­
ated multi­purpose operations, including 
environmental and commercial fishing 
monitoring. The Agency also began closer 
cooperation with Customs authorities 
and became more engaged in fighting 
different types of cross­border crime, in­
cluding arms trafficking. 
One of the key new tasks of the Agency 
is better assessment of vulnerabilities of 
Europe’s national border authorities in 
the light of potential challenges at their 
external borders. In 2017, the Agency will 
conduct its first assessment of vulnerabili­
ties at the Member States’ external borders 
and will issue recommendations on how 
these vulnerabilities need to be addressed. 
The European Border and Coast Guard, 
made up of national border authorities 
and Frontex, was designed to meet mi­
gration challenges faced by the EU. As 
migration management goes far beyond 
border control, only a comprehensive 
strategy will make it effective. In 2017, 
the Agency will propose an operational 
Integrated Border Management strategy 
for the EU. It will take into consideration 
factors that affect migratory movements 
within the EU but also conditions beyond 
Europe’s borders. 
It is clear that cooperation with mi­
grants’ countries of origin and transit is 
one of key elements of a successful mi­
gration management. From exchange of 
information to cooperation on returns, 
Frontex has been extending its reach be­
yond Europe. In 2016, Frontex deployed 
its first Liaison Officer to Turkey. This 
year, Frontex Liaison Officers will be de­
ployed to priority countries in Africa and 
the Western Balkans. 
Last year the Agency also significantly 
increased its activities in the area of 
returns, returning more than 10 000 
non­EU nationals with negative asylum 
decisions or no right to stay in the EU. 
This compares with some 3 500 effective 
returns in 2015. Returns remain a prior­
ity in 2017, as the overall level of effective 
returns to non­EU countries has not in­
creased significantly, despite the massive 
number of migrants arriving in the EU. 
To help address the returns challenge, 
a newly­created pool of return experts 
is now at the disposal of Member States 
organising return operations.
In 2016, in addition to migration man­
agement, Frontex started to collect and 
process personal data for risk analysis 
purposes and in support of criminal in­
vestigations. In February, during the 
Joint Operation Triton in the Central 
Mediterranean, the Agency launched a 
pilot project known as Processing Per­
sonal Data for Risk Analysis (PeDRA). Its 
aim is to process the personal data col­
lected during interviews with migrants 
newly arrived in Italy.
The new mandate of the Agency puts 
more emphasis on the collection of per­
sonal data. As a result, the PeDRA project 
has been extended to Frontex operational 
activities in Spain and Greece, and has 
recently become part of all Joint Opera­
tions as a regular practice. It allows closer 
cooperation with Europol and the secu­
rity and law­enforcement agencies of the 
EU and the Member States. 
The recent terrorist attacks in France, 
Belgium and Germany clearly demon­
strate that border management has an 
important security component. National 
authorities discovered that several for­
eign terrorist fighters had entered Europe 
posing as migrants. As Daesh continues 
to lose territory, many of its fighters are 
likely to attempt to move (or return) to 
Europe. Together with the national au­
thorities and European partner agen­
cies, Frontex remains committed and 
vigilant in its efforts to ensure security 
of Europe’s borders.

2. Summary
In 2016, a drop in detections reported at 
the external borders with Turkey and 
Western Balkan countries led to an over­
all decrease in detections of illegal bor­
der­crossing at EU level. However, with 
over half a million detections (511 371), 
the figure is still significantly higher 
than any yearly total between 2010 
(104 060) and 2014 (282 933). This means 
that the pressure on the external bor­
ders of the EU remained exceptionally 
high in 2016.
The migratory pressure at the EU’s 
external borders with Turkey has been 
easing since October 2015. An impor­
tant factor in this regard is the EU­Tur­
key statement, which came into force in 
March 2016, in which Turkey agreed to 
secure its maritime and land borders and 
accept the return of irregular migrants 
from Greece. The statement has largely 
removed the incentive for migrants to 
take irregular migration routes to Greece 
and has undermined the business model 
of people­smuggling networks. Several 
measures introduced to prevent illegal 
border­crossing along the Western Bal­
kan route have also discouraged many 
irregular migrants from making the dan­
gerous sea crossing to the Greek Eastern 
Aegean Islands.
Nevertheless, Greek Hotspots saw sev­
eral riots last year resulting in injuries 
and material damage. Similar security 
problems and overcrowding in Bulgaria 
reflected persistent tensions in reception 
facilities and the precarious situation of 
migrants and refugees.
Never before had detections been so 
high in the Central Mediterranean area, 
with 181 459 in 2016, which is 18% more 
than in 2015. For the third consecutive 
year, detections in the Central Mediter­
ranean Sea have exceeded 100 000. At 
the same time, IOM data show that the 
number of deaths and missing persons 
– a rough estimate due to the absence of 
passenger lists and the few bodies actu­
ally recovered – increased from 3 175 in 
2015 to over 4 500 in 2016. The increase 
in fatalities occurred despite enhanced 
operational efforts and the fact that most 
rescue operations took place close to, 
or sometimes within, Libyan territo­
rial waters.
A staggering 96% of newly­arrived mi­
grants interviewed in the Central Mediter­
ranean region stated that they had used 
the services of smuggling networks to il­
legally enter the EU. This suggests that 
irregular migration via Libya is entirely 
dependent on the services of the smug­
gling networks. Therefore, any activity 
that would disrupt or deter these groups 
could significantly curb the flow of irreg­
ular migrants into the EU.
The increasing number of vulnera­
ble persons moving through the Central 
Mediterranean, in particular Nigerian 
women, makes it very clear that effec­
tive detection of people trafficked for sex­
ual exploitation, forced labour and other 
purposes remains a major challenge for 
border authorities.
The establishment of Hotspots in 
southern Italy helped to considerably 
improve the registration of new arriv­
als. However, many arriving migrants 
were also disembarked outside Hotspot 
areas, which undermined the uniform 
application of registration rules. More­
over, after having been registered in the 
Hotspots, many migrants simply left the 
reception centres without notification 
or proper documentation. It should be 
stressed that movement of people with­
out proper documentation within the 
EU carries serious implications for in­
ternal security.
As in the case of the Central Medi­
terranean, never before had detections 
on the Western Mediterranean route 
been as high as in 2016, with more than 
10 000 detections. This is 46% more than 
in 2015 on the same route, and 21% more 
than in 2011, the previous record­break­
ing year. As in the Central Mediterra­
nean, most migrants were from Africa, 
which indicates the growing pressure of 
illegal immigration from this continent 
towards the EU.

In terms of nationalities, for the 
fourth consecutive year, people claim­
ing to be Syrian nationals (17% of total 
EU) represented the highest share of ir­
regular migrants entering the EU in 2016. 
They were followed by Afghans (11%), who 
accounted for the second largest number 
of illegal border­crossings. The number 
of Iraqis was also notable representing 
more than 6% of detections. 
Coinciding with an increase in the 
Central Mediterranean and Western 
Mediterranean, detections of African 
migrants reached a record high of over 
170 000 (+22% over 2015), compared with 
the average of about 40 000 detections 
between 2009 and 2013. This influx re­
veals a steady increase in migration pres­
sure from the African continent and, in 
particular, from West Africa. Indeed, 
most of the growth over 2015 was due 
to a higher number of detections of Ni­
gerians (+71%), Guineans, Ivorians and 
Gambians. Altogether in 2016, West Af­
ricans accounted for more than 100 000 
detections, a total roughly comparable 
with the number of migrants from the 
Middle East reported for illegally cross­
ing the border from Turkey. 
In 2016, more than 7 000 people were 
detected with fraudulent documents at 
the EU’s external borders. This represents 
a decrease of about 15% compared with 
the previous year. However, as in 2015, 
the number of people detected travel­
ling with fraudulent documents within 
the EU proved higher than at the exter­
nal borders (almost 11 000 reported in 
2016). In addition to the smuggling of 
migrants, document fraud emerged as 
a key criminal activity linked to the mi­
gration crisis. Fraudulent documents can 
be in fact used or re­used for many other 
criminal activities. This will continue to 
represent a substantial threat to the se­
curity of the EU in 2017.
Within the Schengen free­move­
ment area, several EU Member States 
and Schengen Associated Countries 
(Germany, Austria, France, Sweden, 
Denmark and Norway) introduced tem­
porary controls at specific border sec­
tions. These controls have been extended 
until the first months of 2017 amid con­
tinued concerns about managing spon­
taneous flows.
Even though Turkey accepted a num­
ber of irregular migrants from Greece and 
a greater number of failed asylum appli­
cants were returned to Western Balkan 
countries, the overall number of effective 
returns at EU level remained relatively 
stable in relation to 2015, with 176 223 ef­
fective returns reported in 2016 (+0.6%). 
With regard to returns, the main is­
sue continued to be linked to the difficul­
ties in obtaining travel documents from 
countries of origin in time. This was par­
ticularly the case for some West African 
countries (e.g. Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea and 
Senegal) that have a limited consular 
presence in the EU. These countries also

10 of 60
Frontex · Risk Analysis for 2017
showed the largest discrepancies between 
the number of their citizens detected for 
illegal border­crossing (113 935) and those 
effectively returned (6 497) in 2016.
Overall, there is an underlying threat 
of terrorism­related travel movements. 
This is mainly due to the fact that the 
Syrian conflict has attracted thousands 
of foreign fighters, including EU citi­
zens, dual­nationality holders and third­
country nationals. At the beginning of 
2017, the main jihadist organisations 
(e.g. Daesh) have experienced consid­
erable military setbacks in Syria, Iraq 
and Libya. Since Daesh’s military de­
mise is now increasingly likely on the 
three theatres, it might encourage some 
foreign fighters to return to their home 
countries (among others EU Member 
States). As some of them may pose a 
threat to internal security, the role of 
border authorities in monitoring their 
cross­border movements will be increas­
ingly important.
3. Introduction
Frontex operational activities aim at 
strengthening border security through 
the coordination of Member States’ ac­
tions regarding the implementation of 
EU measures for the management of ex­
ternal borders. The coordination of op­
erational activities contributes to more 
efficient allocation of Member States’ re­
sources and better protection of the area 
of freedom, security and justice. In this 
context, the Risk Analysis for 2017 concen­
trates on the scope of Frontex operational 
activities and, in particular, on irregular 
migration at the external borders of the 
EU and Schengen Associated Countries. 
Since the new Regulation (EU) 
2016 / 1624 came into effect last October, 
the mandate of Frontex has significantly 
changed to ensure efficient implementa­
tion of European Integrated Border Man­
agement as a shared responsibility of the 
Union, the Agency and of the national au­
thorities. The integrated border manage­
ment has several key components. Some 
of the most important ones are: the coast 
guard function and associated SAR opera­
tions; the monitoring of migratory flows 
towards and within the EU; the preven­
tion and detection of cross­border crime 
(i.e. migrant smuggling, THB and ter­
rorism); the analysis of risks for internal 
security and of threats affecting the secu­
rity of the external borders; vulnerabil­
ity assessments; and return operations. 
Clearly, this major change has im­
portant implications for the analytical 
work performed by Frontex as its risk 
analysis should cover all aspects of Inte­
grated Border Management and develop 
a pre­warning mechanism. However, 
since the new Frontex regulation only 
entered into force in October 2016, the 
Risk Analysis for 2017 cannot offer an exhaus­
tive analytic coverage of all new tasks 
and operational activities. These new 
elements will be integrated in future 
risk analyses. Nonetheless, the present 
analysis attempts to address as many of 
them as possible.
This annual report is structured as fol­
lows: (1) situational picture with empha­
sis on identified migratory trends and 
surveillance activities utilising a set of 
reliable indicators on irregular migra­
tion; (2) featured analyses on key risks 
affecting the security of the external bor­
ders and / or internal security (e.g. smug­
gling networks in Libya, return system 
vulnerabilities, and the situation at mi­
grant reception centres).
The Frontex Risk Analysis Unit (RAU) 
would like to express its gratitude to all 
members of the Frontex Risk Analysis 
Network (FRAN) in Member States for 
their efforts in providing data and in­
formation, as well as Europol, the Eu­
ropean Asylum Support Office (EASO), 
the European Union Agency for Funda­
mental Rights (FRA), the European Com­
mission, the European External Action 
Service (EEAS), EU Intelligence Analysis 
Centre (INTCEN), UNHCR, and all Fron­
tex colleagues involved in the prepara­
tion of this report.

4. Methodology
A coherent and comprehensive analy­
sis of the risks affecting security at the 
external borders requires, above all, 
the adoption of common indicators. 
Consistent monitoring of these indica­
tors will allow effective measures to be 
taken on the ground. The analysis needs 
to identify the risks that arise at the ex­
ternal borders themselves and those that 
arise in third countries.
The backbone of the Risk Analysis for 
2017 is the monthly statistics exchanged 
among Member States within the frame­
work of the FRAN. For the Risk Analysis for 
2017, the key indicators collected through 
the FRAN were: detections of illegal bor­
der­crossing through the green border 
or at BCPs; refusals of entry; detections 
of illegal stay; detections of facilitators; 
detections of fraudulent documents; re­
turn decisions; effective returns; and 
passenger flow data (when available). 
Data on asylum applications are still be­
ing collected within the FRAN, but Fron­
tex increasingly relies on data collected 
by EASO, which has contributed to the 
dedicated section on asylum.
The data were categorised by border 
type (land, air or sea) and those on land 
borders were additionally grouped by 
border section with neighbouring third 
countries. The data exchanged within 
the FRAN are compiled and analysed on 
a quarterly basis. Priority is given to the 
use of the data for management purposes 
and to their fast sharing among Member 
State border­control authorities.
Member States’ data processed by 
Frontex are not treated as official statis­
tics and thus may occasionally vary from 
those officially published by national au­
thorities. Throughout 2016, some FRAN 
members performed backdated updates 
of their 2015 statistics. These updates 
have been accounted for in this docu­
ment, hence some data presented here 
may differ from those presented a year 
ago in the Risk Analysis for 2016.
Member States were not requested to 
answer specific questions in support of 
this analysis. Rather, bimonthly analyt­
ical reports and incident reports of Mem­
ber States routinely collected within the 
FRAN, as well as other Member States’ 
contributions submitted in 2016 were 
important sources of information, es­
pecially as regards the analysis of routes 
and modi operandi. Additionally, the out­
comes of debriefing activities carried 
out in the framework of Joint Opera­
tions constituted essential analytical 
material. Open­source information was 
also effectively exploited, especially in 
identifying the main push and pull fac­

tors for irregular migration to the EU. 
Among others, these sources included 
reports issued by government agencies, 
international and non­governmental 
organisations, as well as mainstream 
news agencies and official EU reports, 
such as the European Commission’s re­
ports on third countries.
External borders refer to the borders 
between Member States and third coun­
tries. The borders between the Schengen 
Associated Countries (Norway, Iceland, 
and Switzerland) and third countries are 
also considered as external borders. By 
contrast, the borders between the Schen­
gen Associated Countries and Schengen 
Member States are considered as internal 
borders. For the indicators on detections 
of facilitators, illegal stay and asylum, 
statistics are also reported for detections 
at the land borders between Schengen 
Member States and those Member States 
that have either not joined the Schen­
gen area yet (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, 
Romania) or have opted to stay out of 
it (the UK, Ireland). Thus, a total for 
Member States and Schengen Associ­
ated Countries as a whole can be pre­
sented. It was not possible to make the 
aforementioned distinction for air and 
sea borders because Member States do 
not habitually differentiate between ex­
tra­EU and intra­EU air and sea connec­
tions but tend to aggregate data for all 
arrivals per airport.
Consistent with other law­enforce­
ment indicators, variation in admin­
istrative data related to border control 
depends on several factors. In this case, 
the number of detections of illegal bor­
der­crossing and refusals of entry are 
both functions of the amount of effort 
spent, respectively, on detecting mi­
grants and the actual flow of irregu­
lar migrants to the EU. For example, 
increased detections of illegal border­
crossing might be due to a real increase 
in the flow of irregular migrants, or may 
in fact be an outcome of more resources 
made available to detect them. In excep­
tional cases, increased resources may 
produce a rise in reported detections 
while effectively masking the actual de­
crease in the migratory flow, resulting 
from a strong deterrent effect.

Latest situation 2016  
Reported cases
5.1. Main trends
In 2016, the decrease of detections of ille­
gal border­crossing was due to fewer de­
tections reported at the external borders 
with Turkey and Western Balkan coun­
tries. However, with over half a million 
detections of illegal border­crossing, the 
figure is still significantly higher than 
any yearly total between 2010 (104 060) 
and 2014 (282 933). This indicates that the 
pressure on the external borders of the 
EU remained exceptionally high in 2016.
According to EASO, the number 
of asylum applications made in 2016 
dropped significantly after the unprec­
edented influx in the second half of 2015 
(with around 180 000 applicants recorded 
in the EU Member States plus Norway 
and Switzerland in October 2016), yet 
still remained higher than in previous 
years. In contrast to 2015, the large num­
ber of applications lodged was not fully 
reflective of increased arrivals at the EU 
external borders. More significant in this 
regard were initiatives undertaken in 
certain Member States to increase their 
registration capacity and better deal with 
the backlog of people who had arrived 
in 2015 but had not been able to lodge 
their claim for international protection. 
For example, both Germany and Swe­
den developed a new approach to the 
asylum procedure in order to make it 
more efficient.1
Certain countries continued to see 
a surge in applications after the sum­
mer period. In June 2016, Greece, with 
the cooperation of the European Asylum 
Support Office (EASO) and the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refu­
gees (UNHCR), set up a large­scale ex­
1 Contribution to EPS monthly data 
collection: Germany, Sweden
ercise to pre­register asylum seekers in 
the mainland Greece, providing them 
with asylum seeker cards valid for one 
year, pending the full lodging of their 
asylum application. Pre­registered per­
sons could formally lodge their appli­
cations from September, triggering an 
increase in the number of applications 
filed in Greece.2 Italy, the second main 
receiving country after Germany (and 
before France and Greece) was charac­
terised by a gradual rise in applications 
for international protection, reflecting 
an increase in arrivals on the Central 
Mediterranean route.3
From the beginning of 2016 till the 
end of November, close to 150 000 appli­
cations were withdrawn, either explic­
itly or implicitly. In 2016, almost one in 
three withdrawn applications was an 
explicit withdrawal, indicating a possi­
ble shift towards more voluntary returns 
from important destination countries.
While activities linked to surveillance 
received a lot of media attention, border 
checks are undoubtedly the core activities 
of border­control authorities, with mil­
lions of checks on entry and exit carried 
out each year. At the macro level, two fac­
tors contributed to shape passenger flow 
in recent past. The first is the visa liber­
alisation policy and local border traffic 
agreements that resulted in higher pas­
senger flows, mostly at the external land 
borders with Western Balkan countries. 
The second is the growing overall num­
ber of passengers, in particular at air bor­

ders, due to a greater number of available 
flight connections and increased mobility.
Based on Eurostat data, in the course 
of 2014 and 2015 (latest year with com­
plete statistics available), the upward 
trend already observed in passenger 
transport by air in previous years was 
confirmed at EU­28 level. An increase of 
4.1% was recorded between 2013 and 2014 
and the figures for 2015 indicate a year­
on­year rise of 4.4% compared with 2014.
At the land border, according to par­
tial information from Member States, 
the largest inward passenger traffic was 
recorded at the Croatian external land 
border, followed by entries from Morocco 
to Spain through Ceuta and Melilla. En­
tries from Ukraine to Poland and from 
the Russian Federation to Poland and 
Finland were also significant.
In 2015, 14.3 million short­term uni­
form Schengen visas were issued, con­
stituting a decrease of 9% compared with 
2014. The decrease was mostly due to 
fewer visas being applied for and issued 
to Russian citizens, a trend attributed to 
the economic downturn. In contrast to 
the large number of short­term uniform 
Schengen visas, the number of long­
term visas was much lower, totalling 
109 505 in 2015, a number that was de­
creasing since 2011, when 322 034 long­
term visas were issued.
Migrant smugglers frequently abuse 
legal channels to facilitate the entry of ir­
regular migrants to the EU or to legalise 
their stay. The abuse of legal channels in­
volves a variety of modi operandi including 
sham marriages, bogus paternity claims, 
false employment contracts, fake invita­
tion letters, false medical visas, and false 
claims of being a refuge or a victim of hu­
man trafficking. In many cases, migrant 
smuggling networks operate as legal busi­
ness structures in the EU, such as travel 
agencies, to produce fraudulent paper­
work which allows irregular migrants 
to obtain work permits. These methods 
have proven very successful for the net­
works involved and their use is expected 
to further increase in the future.4
4 Europol’s contribution
In 2016, a total of 206 656 refusals of 
entry were reported at the external bor­
ders of the EU. This is 49% higher than 
the year before. The increase is partially 
due to a change in reporting practice and 
thus the comparison between years does 
not reflect the actual annual trend. Re­
fusals of entry represented only a frac­
tion of passenger flow, indicating that 
the overwhelming number of passen­
gers crossing the borders are bona fide 
travellers.
More than 7 000 people were detected 
in 2016 with fraudulent documents at the 
EU external borders. This represented 
a decrease of 15% compared with the 
previous year. As in 2015, in 2016 there 
were more detections of persons travel­
ling with fraudulent documents within 
the EU than detections at the external 
borders, with almost 11 000 persons re­
ported during the year.
In 2016, Member States reported 
491 891 detections of illegal stay, which 
represented a generally decreasing trend 
compared with 2015 (­30%). As in previ­
ous years, Germany continued to rank 
first, which reflected its status as the 
main destination for most migrants who 
have crossed the border illegally. France 
followed, partly due to the fact that it 
was a transit country for migrants who 
entered the EU illegally and intended to 
reach the UK.
The facilitation of illegal immigra­
tion remains a serious threat to the EU 
and many facilitators continue to op­
erate from third countries. Within the 
EU, detections of facilitators rose from 
12 023 in 2015 to 12 568 in 2016. The rise 
was mostly due to increases reported in 
Spain, France and Italy. Europol noted 
that organised crime groups (OCGs) in­
volved in migrant smuggling have be­
come more flexible and sophisticated. 
Migrant smugglers anticipate law­en­
forcement actions and prepare for policy 
changes. Their countermeasures include 
shifting routes, using forerunner cars or 
travelling by less frequently controlled 
means of public transport.
Some progress was made with Tur­
key in accepting irregular migrants from 
Greece and there was some increase in 
the number of migrants returned to 
Western Balkan countries after their 
asylum applications in the EU were re­
jected. However, the overall number of 
effective returns at the EU level remained 
relatively stable compared with 2015, 
with about 176 223 effective returns re­
ported in 2016 (+0.6%).

Figure 1. Detections of illegal border-crossing, by main nationalities (scale in 
absolute numbers, with labels showing percentages of total) in 2016 
factor in this regard is the EU­Turkey 
statement that came into force in March 
2016, in which Turkey agreed to secure 
its maritime and land borders and ac­
cept the return of irregular migrants 
from Greece. The statement has largely 
removed the incentive for migrants to 
take irregular migration routes to Greece 
and has undermined the business model 
of people­smuggling networks.
Although the number of migrants re­
admitted from Greece to Turkey remained 
relatively modest, readmissions, com­
bined with a more effective prevention 
Following the record figures of 2015, in 
2016 Member States reported a lower 
number of detections of illegal border­
crossing along the EU’s external borders. 
A total of 511 371 detections was reported 
by EU Member States in 2016, which rep­
resented a 72% decrease compared with 
1.8 million detections in 2015.
The decrease was due to considerably 
fewer detections reported at the borders 
with Turkey and Western Balkan coun­
tries. However, with over half a million de­
tections of illegal border­crossing in 2016, 
the figure is still significantly higher than 
any yearly total between 2010 (104 060) 
and 2014 (282 933). This indicates that the 
pressure on the external borders of the 
EU remained exceptionally high in 2016. 
For the fourth consecutive year, per­
sons declaring to be Syrian (17% of total 
EU) represented the highest share of mi­
grants illegally entering the EU in 2016. 
They were followed by Afghans (11%).
Coinciding with the increase in the 
Central and Western Mediterranean, de­
tections of African migrants reached a 
record high of over 180 000, compared 
with an average of about 40 000 detec­
tions between 2009 and 2013. This surge 
reveals a steady increase in migration 
pressure from the African continent, 
and in particular West Africa. 
EU Member States also reported a 
large number of ‘not specified’ nation­
als (20%). Most of these were recorded 
during the first quarter of 2016. Later 
on in the year, as the number of arrivals 
decreased, EU Member States resumed 
screening migrants and reported their 
claimed nationalities more consistently.

of departures from the Turkish coast, 
resulted in a significant drop in arrivals 
even during summer months. Several 
measures introduced to prevent illegal 
border­crossing along the Western Balkan 
route have also discouraged many from 
making the dangerous sea crossing to 
reach the Greek Eastern Aegean Islands.
With fewer options to continue to 
other EU Member States, many migrants 
applied for asylum in Greece, where 
asylum applications increased signifi­
cantly in 2016. However, many centres 
remained overcrowded leading to ten­
sions among migrants as well as between 
migrants and local residents. There were 
persistent riots and demonstrations on 
Lesbos, Chios and Samos islands.
At the Greek and Bulgarian external land 
borders with Turkey, detections totalled over 
6 000, fewer than in 2015, with relatively 
similar numbers of detections reported from 
Greece and Bulgaria. Despite the decreased 
number of detections at the border, more 
migrants were staying in camps in Bul­
garia. This was the result of stricter meas­
ures against illegal stayers in the country, 
as well as more effective prevention of exit 
through the border to Serbia.
Western Balkan route
As the flow of migrants across the West­
ern Balkans continued to reflect the 
influx on the Eastern Mediterranean 
route, detections in the region decreased 
sharply from 764 038 in 2015 to 130 261 in 
2016. The decline was steady throughout 
2016, from more than 60 000 in Janu­
ary to less than 2 000 detections start­
ing from September.
The main migratory movement across 
the Western Balkans was the flow from the 
Greek land border with the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia towards the Hun­
garian land border with Serbia. In addi­
tion, higher detections were also reported 
on exit by Romania and Bulgaria at their 
respective land borders with Serbia, mostly 
involving migrants who had illegally en­
tered Bulgaria from Turkey and then tried 
to reach other EU Member States. This took 
place in a context of a decreasing number 
of detections at the land border between 
Bulgaria and Turkey, thereby suggesting 
a higher risk of migrants crossing this bor­
der section undetected.
In Hungary, a new law was passed in 
July 2016 allowing the authorities to re­
turn all migrants detected up to 8 km in­
19 of 60
Frontex · Risk Analysis for 2017
side the country to specially designated 
transit zones at the country’s external 
borders. Once they arrive in the transit 
areas, migrants must wait for registra­
tion and legal admission into Hungary 
(at a rate of 30 per day) or voluntarily re­
turn to Serbia. This legislative change 
also impacted Hungary’s reporting stand­
ards, resulting in fewer reported detec­
tions of illegal border­crossing. However, 
information gathered in the framework 
of Joint Operations showed that the pres­
sure at this border section persisted, de­
spite a larger number of officers deployed 
and reinforcement of technical obstacles 
put in place along the border.
Although the total volume of migrants 
considerably decreased in 2016, it was also 
more difficult for border authorities in the 
region to stay abreast of the development of 
the migratory flows. The majority of people 
crossing the EU’s external border illegally 
remain stranded in Greece. However, law­
enforcement authorities cannot always 
trace the whereabouts of groups that de­
cided to bypass the border barriers to reach 
their destinations in Western and North­
ern Europe. Consequently, the migrant 
routes running through Europe, and in 
particular through the Western Balkans, 
are getting more diversified, dynamic and 
dangerous. Also, more migrants are now 
more likely to cross undetected.
Central Mediterranean route
Detections had never been so high in 
the Central Mediterranean area, with 
181 459, or 18% more than in the previ­
ous year. Since 2014, the number of de­
tections in the Central Mediterranean 
Sea has exceeded 100 000.
This increase indicates that the route 
faces persistent pressure as migrants 
continue to arrive in Libya, which is 
the main departure country towards Eu­
rope with a well­established presence 
of smuggling networks. As in previous 
years, most migrants were Africans (91% 
of the detections on this route), mostly 
from West Africa. A growing number of 
migrants, also predominantly Africans, 
was reported departing from Egypt, add­
ing to the pressure on this route.
For the third consecutive year, detec­
tions on this route exceeded 150  000, 
compared with an annual average of just 
30 000 detections between 2008 and 2013. 
At the same time, IOM data show that the 
estimated number of deaths and missing 
persons – a rough estimate due to the ab­
sence of passenger lists and a small num­
ber of bodies actually recovered – increased 
from 3 175 in 2015 to over 4 500 in 2016. The 
death toll increased despite enhanced oper­
ational efforts and the fact that most rescue 
operations took place close to, or some­
times within, Libyan territorial waters.
The establishment of Hotspots in 
southern Italy helped to considerably 
improve migrant registration process. 
However, many migrants continue to 
arrive outside Hotspot areas, thus un­
dermining the benefits of uniform ap­
plication of registration rules.
Western Mediterranean route
As in the Central Mediterranean, never 
before had detections on the Western 
Mediterranean route been so high, ex­
ceeding 10 000. The number represented 
an increase of 46% in relation to the pre­
vious year, and of 21% compared with 
2011, the previous record­breaking year. 
As in the case of the Central Mediterra­
nean route, most migrants were from 
Africa, indicating a growing pressure 
of illegal immigration from this conti­
nent towards the EU.
Nevertheless, the situation differed 
considerably at the land and sea border. 
At the land borders of Ceuta and Melilla, 
yearly detections near the fences hit a 
record low of about 1 000. However, in 
the last month of 2016, some 400 sub­
Saharan African migrants – the biggest 
group in a decade – forced their way into 
Ceuta. So far sub­Saharans had tended to 
try and climb over the fence to Melilla. 
By contrast, detections at the sea border 
had never been so high (at over 8 000). 
The detected migrants departed from the 
Moroccan and Algerian coasts towards 
the southern shores of Spain. Most de­
tections were reported around the Strait 
of Gibraltar, where the majority of mi­
grants opted for small rubber dinghies to 
make the crossing, some equipped with 
a small engine. This is a very dangerous 
modus operandi, especially amid more dif­
ficult weather conditions. In contrast to 
vessels used in the Central Mediterra­
nean, the boats used to reach Spain from 
Morocco typically carry fewer migrants. 
However, a large number of attempts re­
ported also indicates that some of these 
boats are likely to pass undetected. In­
deed, reports from the JO Indalo men­
tion the discovery of boats, most probably 
used for illegal crossing, left abandoned 
on the Spanish shores.
Western African routes
The number of detections on the Western 
African route, which connects Senegal, 
Mauritania and Morocco with the Canary 
Islands in Spain, continued at a low level, 
even though since 2015 the total has been 
higher than the average in the period be­
tween 2010 and 2014 (less than 300), In 
2016, as in 2015, most departures were re­
ported from Morocco. This low number 
is attributed to the Memorandum of Un­
derstanding between Spain, Senegal and 
Mauritania, which includes joint sur­
veillance activities and effective return 
of those detected crossing the border il­
legally. The low number of departures re­
sulted in relatively few casualties.
Eastern land border route
The eastern land border route is, in 
effect, an amalgam of illegal border­
crossing detections reported by Finland, 
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slo­
vakia, Hungary and Romania. Despite 
the considerable total length of all the 
border sections, detections on this route 
tend to be lower than on other routes, 
possibly due to the long distances be­
tween major hubs and many countries 
of origin. Also, irregular migrants trav­
elling on this route tend to make use of 
visa fraud and counterfeit border­cross­
ing stamps rather than risk an illegal 
border­crossing between BCPs.
About a quarter of these detections in­
volved nationals from neighbouring coun­
tries, mostly Ukrainians, Russians and, 
to a lesser extent, from Belarus and Mol­
dova. Their illegal movements were fo­
cused mostly on the Polish and Romanian 
land border with Ukraine. The majority 
of these cases was associated either with 
smuggling or other reasons not related to 
migration.
Non­regional migrants, mostly Af­
ghans and Vietnamese, constituted 74% 
of the detected cases. While Vietnam­
ese citizens mostly targeted the Latvian­
Russian border, Afghans were, by and 
large, detected at the Hungarian­Ukrain­
ian section. Irregular migration was the 
main reason for crossing the border ille­
gally for both Vietnamese and Afghans.

5.3. Border checks: Refusals of entry
In 2016, a change in reporting require­
ments was introduced, clarifying that 
the reports should specify the number of 
refusals of entry issued rather than the 
number of people refused. Indeed, one 
person may be refused several times. How­
ever, for border management purposes, it 
is better to capture the number represent­
ing the workload for border­control au­
thorities, hence the focus on the number 
of refusals of entry rather than on persons.
In 2016, a total of 206  656 refusals 
of entry were reported along the exter­
nal borders of the EU. This is 49% higher 
than in the previous year, but due to the 
change in reporting requirements, the 
comparison between years does not re­
flect the actual annual trend. Refusals 
of entry represented only a fraction of 
passenger flow, indicating that the over­
whelming number of passengers cross­
ing the borders are bona fide travellers.
Most refusals of entry were reported 
at the land border (151 167, or 73% of the 
total), even though the volume of pas­
senger flow at the land border is lower 
than at the air border. This is linked to 
the nature of the flow at the land border, 
which is mostly composed of commut­
ers and low­budget travellers. Indeed, 
border­control authorities face differ­
ent challenges during border checks at 
air and land borders.
A very significant increase (of around 
170%) in the number of refusals of entry 
was reported at the Polish land border 
with Belarus. Most of the refusals were 
issued to Russian nationals of Chechen 
origin and also, to some extent, Tajiks, 
refusals to whom started to increase in 
February to reach a peak of over 17 000 in 
August. This situation resembles a simi­
lar phenomenon at this border section in 
2013, when migrants showed up without 
visas and then applied for asylum. Later 
on, they also applied for asylum in Ger­
many, which the vast majority of them 
was denied. Indeed, at EU level in 2015, 
about 80% of first­instance applications 
of Russians were rejected. The situation 
repeated itself at the beginning of 2016, 
when Poland and Germany reported co­
incided increased numbers of asylum ap­
plications from Russian nationals. The 
applications peaked over the summer, 
and since then the number of refusals of 
entry and asylum applications of Russian 
nationals in Poland decreased.

5.4. Border checks: Fraudulent documents
In 2016, more than 7 000 people were 
detected using 8 267 fraudulent docu­
ments on entry at the external borders 
of the EU. This represented a decrease 
of 16% compared with the previous year.
Smugglers frequently provide mi­
grants with fraudulent travel and 
identity documents as a part of their 
‘services’. Fraudulent documents allow 
irregular migrants to enter and move 
within the EU as well as to regularise 
their residence status under false pre­
tences or by using fake identities.
Both the quantity and the quality of 
the fraudulent documents circulating 
in the EU have improved over the recent 
years. In most cases, migrant smugglers 
obtain counterfeit documents from ex­
pert counterfeiters who normally work 
with several smuggling networks at the 
same time. The sustained demand for 
fraudulent documents has prompted es­
tablished counterfeiters to increase their 
output and has also prompted the crea­
tion of new print shops.1
Out of the 128 nationalities detected us­
ing fraudulent documents to illegally en­
ter the EU or Schengen area from a third 
country, the most commonly detected 
were Ukrainians (1 208), Moroccans (752), 
Iranians (375), Albanians (386) and Iraqis 
(273). Compared with 2015, Syrians were 
reported in much lower number due to 
fewer detections on arrival from Turkey 
and Morocco. The number of Nigerians 
detected using fraudulent documents de­
creased significantly, mostly at the air 
borders. One of the reasons for this drop 
might be the relatively high price of fraud­
ulent documents compared with other 
modi operandi used to enter the EU, for ex­
ample illegal border­crossing on the Cen­
tral Mediterranean route. Within the EU, 
Nigerians were more often detected with 
fraudulently obtained border stamps pre­
venting them from overstaying, especially 
in the UK.
1  Europol’s contribution
Istanbul Atatürk remains the 
top departure airport
As in the previous year, most detections 
of fraudulent documents were reported 
on air routes. At 620 detections, the num­
ber of document fraud cases from Istan­
bul Atatürk increased by 17% compared 
with 2015. Istanbul Atatürk airport re­
mained the main last departure airport 
of fraudulent document users detected 
on arrival in Member States. Annual de­
tections associated with flights from Is­
tanbul Atatürk airport increased for the 
first time since 2013.
The second most reported last depar­
ture airport was Dakar International Air­
port in Senegal. However, the measures 
implemented by Portugal, such as the de­
ployment of Portuguese document experts 
in Dakar, led to a decrease of detections in 
the second half of 2016.
Compared with 2015, more detections 
were reported of passengers flying from the 
two Kiev airports in 2016, mostly Ukrainian, 
Tajik and Uzbek nationals using fraudu­

lently obtained Latvian and Lithuanian

frequent use of fraudulently obtained Pol­

At land and sea borders, most

from Ukraine and Morocco
In 2016, most of the document fraud 
cases at land borders were again reported 
at the land borders between Ukraine and 
Poland, mainly involving Ukrainian na­
tionals holding fraudulently obtained 
Polish visas. A large number of docu­
ment fraud cases was also reported from 
the Spanish­Moroccan land and sea bor­
ders, with Moroccans often presenting 
fraudulent Spanish ID cards on entry 
to the EU.
Overall decrease of document 
fraud detections on intra-EU / 
Schengen movements
In 2016, the number of detections of doc­
ument fraud within the EU (over 11 000 
in 2016) was lower than in 2015 (about 
13 000), which is consistent with fewer 
detections of illegal border­crossing 
along the EU’s external borders. How­
ever, as in 2015, there were more fraud­
ulent document users detected travelling 
within the EU than those reported at the 
external borders.
According to Europol, in addition to 
the smuggling of migrants, document 
fraud is one of the most common crimi­
nal activities linked to the migration cri­
sis. Fraudulent documents can be used 
or re­used for many other criminal ac­
tivities. The provision of fraudulent 
documents will continue to represent a 
serious threat to the security of the EU.
Within the EU, most persons using 
fraudulent documents were detected on 
entry to the UK. Most of the detections 
were reported on the sea and land route 
between France and the UK, where Alba­
nian and Ukrainian document fraudsters 
were the most detected nationalities, de­
spite a steep decline compared with 2015. 
By contrast, detections of Iraqi and Ira­
nian fraudsters remained stable.
In contrast to the decreasing trend on 
the routes towards the UK from other EU 
Member States, the number of persons 
travelling with fraudulent documents on 
intra­EU / Schengen movements towards 
Germany nearly doubled, amounting to 
almost 1 200 detected cases in 2016. The 
number of detections on the routes to­
wards Germany reached its highest level 
since the beginning of 2013. The vast ma­
jority of cases were detected on arrival 
from Greece, in particular from the air­
ports of Thessaloniki, Athens and Herak­
lion. The cases were almost exclusively 
related to Syrian, Iraqi, Afghan and Ira­
nian nationals. This pattern indicated 
that after the closure of the Western 
Balkan route, a proportion of migrants 
stranded in Greece used fraudulent docu­
ments on intra­Schengen flights to reach 
their desired final destination.
Less secure EU ID cards still 
prevail on intra-EU / Schengen 
movements
EU Member States’ ID cards with fewer 
security features remained the most of­
ten fraudulently used travel documents 
on intra­EU / Schengen movements, in 
particular those issued by Italy, Greece, 
Romania and Bulgaria. Less secure travel 
documents can be more easily forged and 
so are more vulnerable than well­secured 
ones. However, they may also be more 
easily detected by border­control authori­
ties than well­secured documents, which 
may go largely undetected.

Frontex · Risk Analysis for 2017
Document fraud trends at Greek Hotspots
In order to mitigate the risks associated with identity and document fraud, 
Frontex deployed Advanced Level Document Officers (ALDOs) at the migration 
Hotspots during the last quarter of 2015. These experts assist in the identifi­
cation of fraudulent documentation held by arriving migrants. The current 
lower numbers of arriving migrants from Turkey permits a more compre­
hensive examination of documentation to be undertaken at the Hotspots.
Frontex has been collecting detailed weekly reports drafted by ALDOs de­
ployed at Greek Hotspots since October 2016. This has allowed for a better un­
derstanding of the extent of document fraud during the registration process.
On Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos, many migrants are still arriving 
undocumented. Among those who present travel documents, a variety of doc­
uments are being used, but mostly documents from Syria, Iraq and Afghani­
stan. Passports, ID cards and driving licences are most commonly used. Most 
of the cases of document fraud detections at the Hotspots are associated with 
one of these documents.
Between weeks 39–46 of 2016, some 
1 500 documents were examined by 
Frontex ALDOs at the five Hotspots. 
Two­thirds of them were Syrian doc­
uments. Around 5% were reported as 
fraudulent. The highest number of 
examined documents was detected 
on Samos. Of these, only 3% or 17 
documents were identified as being 
fraudulent. Most were poor­quality 
counterfeit Syrian identity cards. 
However, a few high­quality docu­
ments were detected (see picture).

5.5. Border checks: Clandestine entries
In 2016, the number of detections of clan­
destine entries (people hiding in vehicles 
to avoid border control) at BCPs remained 
much lower than the number of detec­
tions of illegal border­crossing between 
BCPs. However, this indicator is not uni­
formly reported by all Member States and 
it is likely that the total number of de­
tections reported for 2016 (2 028) under­
estimates the actual situation.
The rather low number of detections 
of clandestine entry along the external 
borders contrasts with the larger num­
ber of detections of clandestine entry 
reported at the internal borders. For ex­
ample, the UK Chief Inspector of Borders 
and Immigration reported in July 2016 
that over 6 400 migrants were found in 
the back of lorries or cars in Britain be­
tween 1 April and 30 September 2015, 
more than double the number of 2014.1
Most of the 2 028 detections along the 
external borders were reported at the 
land border between Bulgaria and Tur­
key, through which a large share of the

nelled. The Bulgarian BCPs most affected 
by clandestine entries were Kapitan An­
dreevo and Lesovo. The Greek authorities 
started reporting detections of clandes­
tine entry in June 2016.

5.6. Border checks: Illegal stayers, facilitators, asylum applications
Illegal stayers
In 2016, Member States reported 491 891 
detections of illegal stay, which repre­
sented a generally decreasing trend com­
pared with 2015. As in previous years, 
Germany continued to rank first, which 
reflected its status as the main destina­
tion for most migrants who had crossed 
the border illegally. France followed, due 
to its status of a transit country for the 
migrants who entered the EU illegally 
with the intention to reach the UK.
In terms of nationalities, the consid­
erable number of Syrians, Afghans, Ira­
qis and Eritreans is artificially inflated 
by detections of people not meeting re­
quirements for legal stay before they ap­
ply for asylum.
Facilitators
The facilitation of illegal immigra tion re­
mains a significant threat to the EU. De­
tections of facilitators rose from 12 023 in 
2015 to 12 568 in 2016. The rise was mostly 
due to increases reported in Spain, It­
aly, France.
Facilitation services related to the il­
legal immigration to the EU and second­
ary movements between Member States 
are in high demand and generate sig­
nificant profits for facilitators involved. 
The facilitation of illegal immigration is 
a growing market prompting existing 
criminal groups to adapt their business 
models and shift to the facilitation of il­
legal immigration.
An increase in the number of irreg­
ular migrants reaching the EU as part 
of mixed migration flows will sustain 
and increase the demand not only for 
facilitation of entry to the EU, but also 
services associated with legalisation of 
stay. The latter include the use of forged 
identity or supporting documents, mar­
riages of convenience to obtain residence 
permits and the abuse of asylum pro­
visions in order to temporarily obtain 
leave to remain.
Asylum applications
In 2016, 1.1 million applications for inter­
national protection were recorded in the 
28 EU Member States plus Norway and 
Switzerland (EU+). This number came 
close to the 1.23 million applications re­
ported for 2015, the highest level received 
in the EU since EU­level data collection 
began in 2008. 96% of these applications 
accounted for persons applying for the 
first time in the EU.
Further implementation of the relo­
cation mechanism set up in September 
2015 will be necessary for alleviating the 
pressure in Greece and Italy.

5.7. Cross-border crime
For years, Frontex has been promoting 
European border management with a 
special focus on irregular migration 
flows. Based on its new mandate, the 
Agency will develop an operational strat­
egy in line with the concept of Integrated 
Border Management. An important el­
ement of border management is sup­
porting Member States in combating 
organised crime at the external borders, 
including the smuggling of goods and 
trafficking in human beings.
Smuggling of illicit drugs
Cannabis from the Western Balkans 
and North Africa
According to the EMCDDA European 
Drug Report 20161, more than 75% of drug 
seizures in Europe were of cannabis, Mo­
rocco being the main provider, although 
its production is in decline. Spain re­
ported around two­thirds of the total 
quantity of cannabis resin seized in Eu­
rope. In addition, Spain, together with 
Greece and Italy, has also reported large 
increases in seizures of cannabis herb in 
recent years. In September 2016, in an 
operation coordinated by the Guardia 
1 EMCDDA (2016), European Drug Report: 
Trends and Developments, p. 65.
Civil, 19 tonnes of hashish were seized 
on a cargo ship and 12 persons arrested 
in the operational area of the JO Indalo. 
Regarding herbal cannabis, Turkey has 
been seizing larger quantities of herbal 
cannabis than all EU countries combined 
over the past few years.
Cocaine from South America
According to EMCDDA’s calculations for 
2014, 1% of the general population and 
2% of young adults used cocaine in the 
EU. However, seizures, increasing from 
the mid­nineties till 2007, have been de­
clining since 2009. Most of the cocaine 
is seized by Spain, but trafficking routes 
to Europe have been diversifying and sei­
zures were recently made in ports of the 
Eastern Mediterranean, Baltic and Black 
Sea. However, according to available data, 
these routes remained of minor impor­
tance. Moreover, cocaine is smuggled 
on pleasure boats and through container 
shipments, where it is often hidden un­
der legitimate goods, and in air freight.
At the air border, organised criminal 
networks often apply ‘swarming tactics’, 
consisting in ‘flooding’ planes with doz­
ens of couriers per flight in the expecta­
tion that a sufficient number of them 
would slip through controls. As shown 
by examples from the Netherlands, some 
countermeasures have proven success­
ful, such as the establishment of joint 
customs and border guard teams to iden­
tify couriers. However, stricter controls 
on selected high­risk air routes tended 
to lead to the use of alternative routing.
Heroin from Afghanistan, Iran and 
Pakistan
According to the EMCDDA, the overall 
quantity seized in the EU and Norway 
has declined from around 8 tonnes in 
2009 to 5.6 tonnes in 2013, but then in­
creased again to 8.9 tonnes in 2014. No­
tably, there has been a rapid increase in 
the size of individual shipments, with 
seizures of more than 100 kg, exceeding 
even the total quantity of heroin seizures 
reported in 2013.2 Most of the heroin con­
sumed in the EU is produced in Afghan­
istan and transported along a variety of 
routes, including through Turkey and 
Balkan countries, the Northern route, 
which heads through Central Asia and 
the Russian Federation, and the Southern 
route via the Persian Gulf by sea, some­
times including passages through Africa.
The latest annual statistics on seizures 
showed that more heroin was seized in 
Turkey than in all EU Member States 
combined, and the gap in large seizures

shipments. On this route, heroin is of­
ten smuggled into the EU by criminals 
posing as individual travellers in small 
and medium amounts. Regular coopera­
tion between border guards and customs 
authorities is of particular importance 
for the detection of drugs smuggled in 
this way.
Smuggling of weapons
The terrorist attacks in France in 2015 
demonstrated that the effective control 
of firearms is indispensable to fight ter­
rorism. The perpetrators of the terrorist 
attacks of January 2015 on the Charlie 
Hebdo office and a kosher supermarket 
in Paris and of November 2015 on the 
Bataclan theatre reportedly used weap­
ons from the Western Balkans.
Police investigations have generally 
shown a wide availability of military­
grade arms including AK­47s, rocket­pro­
pelled grenade launchers on European 
illicit markets, especially in the dark net, 
which is a network that is not accessible 
through conventional search engines. 
Many of these weapons are illegally 
traded from former conflict regions such 
as the Western Balkans, where around 
800 000 weapons are estimated to be in 
illegal civilian possession in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina alone. A closer cooperation 
and information exchange between Euro­
pean law­enforcement authorities (both 
inland and at the external border) and 
customs authorities is crucial in the effec­
tive fight against trafficking of firearms.
Links between migrant 
smuggling and other cross-
border crimes
Many OCGs are involved in migrant 
smuggling as their main criminal ac­
tivity. However, according to Europol, 
many of the OCGs involved in migrant 
smuggling are poly­criminal and so en­
gage in other criminal activities, includ­
ing document counterfeiting, trafficking 
in human beings, property crime, drug 
trafficking, excise fraud, firearms traf­
ficking, and trafficking in counterfeit 
goods. Other OCGs previously involved 
in these criminal activities have added 
migrant smuggling to their portfolio.
There are tenuous links between mi­
grant smuggling and terrorism involving 
the use of migrant smuggling networks 
and their logistics to support or fund ter­
rorism related activities. At this point, 
however, there is no concrete evidence 
that terrorist groups maintain sustained 
engagement with OCGs involved in mi­
grant smuggling. Nevertheless, it cannot 
be ruled out that terrorists may be using 
migrant smugglers’ resources to achieve 
their goals.
Trafficking in human beings
The rise in irregular migration between 
2015 and 2016 also led to a greater num­
ber of people (including minors and 
women) who can be easily exploited by 
smugglers and traffickers. According 
to a recently published UNODC analy­
sis of global country­level data on THB 
victims and recently arrived regular mi­
grants, trafficking in persons and regu­
lar migration flows in the case of some 
destination countries broadly coincide.3
Some irregular migrants are kid­
napped, held for ransom, or forced to work 
against their will to repay their debts to 
smugglers. For instance, Nigerian irreg­
ular migrants rely on migrant smugglers 
to reach the EU. At the same time, hu­
man traffickers frequently lure Nigerian 
women to Europe for sexual exploitation.
Many irregular migrants become vic­
tims of forced labour or sexual exploita­
tion at some stage during their journey 
to the EU. This particularly affects irreg­
ular migrants travelling on the Central 
Mediterranean route via Libya and, to 
a much lesser extent, those migrating 
along the Eastern Mediterranean route. 
Some irregular migrants who try to reach 
the EU are forced to work at each leg of 
their journey to pay migrant smugglers. 
Higher prices of facilitation services also 
increase the risk of exploitation in coun­
tries of transit and arrival.
So far, irregular migrants do not ap­
pear to be subject to systematic abuse 
once they reach the EU, even though in­
dividual cases were reported. For exam­
ple, in December 2016, police in northern

Greece freed two asylum seekers, a Syr­
ian and an Iraqi man, who had been 
locked in a room for more than a week 
for failing to pay transit fees after being 
smuggled across the border from Turkey.
Exit of stolen motor vehicles
According to Eurostat, the total number 
of vehicles including cars, motorcycles, 
buses, lorries, construction and agricul­
tural vehicles stolen in the EU was stead­
ily falling between 1998 and 2013. Among 
the reasons for the decline were the ad­
vanced anti­theft technologies developed 
by the producers and intensified inter­
national law­enforcement cooperation.
Only a small share of the vehicles sto­
len in the EU is detected at its external 
borders, often in the context of Frontex 
Joint Operations.
Smuggling of excise goods
The majority of excise goods smuggled 
across the EU’s external borders are to­
bacco products. According to estimates 
of the European Commission, the illicit 
trade in tobacco products costs the EU 
and its Member States EUR 10 billion a 
year in lost tax revenues. It should be 
stressed that it is not only individual con­
sumers and small­scale smugglers from 
economically weak border regions that 
try to take advantage of existing price 
differences. In fact, also large­scale crim­
inal businesses illicitly import cigarettes 
from as far away as Asia, especially to 
Western European markets.
In 2016, seizures of 28 000 000 illicit 
cigarettes were reported in the frame­
work of Frontex JOs. Half of this num­
ber was reported from Greece, more than 
11 million cigarettes were seized at the 
eastern borders, about 1.2 million on 
the Western Balkan route and almost 
300 000 at the Spanish border.
In 2016, during Frontex JOs, 96 
tonnes of drugs and 36 tonnes of 
smuggled cigarettes were seized. 
Several incidents of illegal fishery 
and pollution at sea were detected 
during maritime JOs, as well as a 
number of stolen vehicles at the land 
borders.

5.8. In the EU: Secondary movements
Obstacles on the way to a better 
situational picture of intra-
Schengen secondary routes
Also in 2016, Europe saw massive move­
ments of people who crossed the external 
border of the EU illegally and decided to 
move on to other Member States. Mov­
ing within the EU, irregular migrants 
use a variety of modi operandi and means 
of transport, which makes the strategic 
analysis of intra­Schengen secondary 
movements extremely difficult.
The effect of the migration 
crisis of 2015–2016 on secondary 
movements
Large migration flows, as witnessed dur­
ing the crisis of 2015–2016, made sec­
ondary routes more visible for strategic 
analysis. The concerted efforts of the 
countries along the Western Balkan 
route to close their borders and to end the 
facilitated travel through their territories 
resulted in reducing the visible flow of 
people on the most frequented second­
ary route through the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia, Serbia, Croa­
tia / Hungary and further on to Austria 
and Germany. However, detections re­
ported from Member States showed that 
these movements continued after March 
2016, although at a lower level and in a 
more covert way. The reinstatement of 
controls at the internal borders of some 
Member States led to a diversification in 
routes and modi operandi. Also, the rise in 
migration pressure at the Central Medi­
terranean route brought about changes 
in the extent to which certain Member 
States were affected by the migration 
of undocumented persons on secondary 
routes within the EU and Schengen area.
South-Eastern route: reported 
attempts to bypass Austria
In 2016, the level of intra­Schengen mi­
gration of persons coming from the East­
ern Mediterranean and Western Balkan 
route was far lower than in 2015 – even 
though secondary routes became more 
diverse.
In 2016, Hungary reported more than 
25 000 illegal border­crossings from Ser­
bia, which is a significant decrease from 
around 200 000 migrants that crossed 
this border section in 2015. Croatia, which 
became the main transit country of ir­
regular migration after Hungary, built a 
technical obstacle at its border with Ser­
bia in September 2015. It led to a signifi­
cant decline in irregular migration, from 
more than 500 000 illegal border­cross­
ings in 2015 to just over 100 000 in 2016.
Most of these migrants, after having 
transited Hungary or Croatia, continued 
to travel to Austria and further on to Ger­
many. In fact, Germany reported most 
detections of intra­Schengen movements 
of nationalities typically coming through 
the Eastern Mediterranean route near 
the Austrian border. At this location, in 
2016, most irregular migrants were de­
tected travelling by train and, to a lesser 
extent, in private vehicles provided by 
facilitation networks.
Southern route: increasing 
importance of Switzerland as a 
transit country
In May 2016, when Austria upgraded the 
controls of its national border with It­
aly, the Austrian authorities started to 
stop migrants at this internal border and 
arranged for their readmission to Italy. 
Because of these measures, many irreg­
ular migrants who had arrived in Italy 
via the Central Mediterranean Sea de­
cided to bypass Austria in their attempt 
to reach their desired destinations in 
Northern Europe.
The number of African illegal stayers 
who primarily entered the EU through 
the Central Mediterranean route sig­
nificantly decreased in Austria, while 
at the same time grew in Switzerland. 
German detections of travelling irregu­
lar migrants from Africa seem to confirm 
this change. Whereas the number of per­
sons entering Germany from Austria de­
creased, more detections were made at 
the border with Switzerland.
France was also affected by a grow­
ing number of migrants arriving on sec­
ondary migration routes from Italy. The 
number of French Eurodac hits in rela­
tion to a prior asylum application or ille­
gal border­crossing in Italy (about 11 000) 
increased by more than 156% compared 
with the same period of the previous 
year. The vast majority of these hits was 
related to migrants who had arrived on 
the Central Mediterranean route.
Substantial secondary flows 
from Hungary to Italy and 
France
In addition, Member State reports in 
2016, especially Eurodac data, point to 
an important corridor of intra­Schengen 
movements along the Eastern Mediterra­
nean and then Western Balkan route to­
wards Italy. In 2016, the country reported 
over 10 000 Eurodac hits related to ille­
gal border­crossings or prior asylum ap­
plications in Hungary. They were mainly 
triggered by Pakistani and Afghan na­
tionals. Moreover, Eurodac hits in Italy 
related to Greece increased to around 
5 000. The reported Eurodac numbers 
clearly point to a smaller branch of the 
Western Balkans route leading to Italy.
Also, intra­Schengen FRAN data re­
ported by France showed an increase 
in asylum applicants who had previ­
ously been fingerprinted in Hungary. 
Compared with the previous year, the 
number of Eurodac hits decreased to over 
6 000 in 2016.
Western route: increase in 
secondary movements
While detections at the EU’s external bor­
ders along the Western Mediterranean 
route increased by 46% compared with 
2015, French data also point to increases 
on the secondary routes from Spain and 
Portugal. The number of French Eurodac 
hits related to prior detections of illegal 
border­crossings or asylum applications 
28 of 60
Frontex · Risk Analysis for 2017
in Spain and, to a lesser extent, in Por­
tugal increased by 14% (to 1 198) between 
2015 and 2016.
Analysis of open sources reveals that 
the migrants who reached Spain on the 
Western Mediterranean route often con­
tinued to Central and Northern Europe 
travelling in private cars provided by fa­
cilitators in return for a fee.
Eastern route: number of 
Russian nationals rising
In 2016, the German authorities detected 
about 2 000 irregular migrants on intra­
Schengen movements from Poland. Al­
though the number was lower than in 
2015, other reports point to increasing 
flows from Belarus and Poland to Ger­
many, mainly of Russian nationals of re­
portedly Chechen origin. Many of these 
migrants travelled by train from Minsk 
and entered the Schengen area in the 
Polish city of Terespol, from where many 
continued their journey to Germany.
Both Poland and Germany detected 
a large proportion of Russian nationals 
in private vehicles, travelling along the 
European Route E30, which connects 
Terespol (at the Belarusian border) with 
Warsaw and Berlin.

5.9. In the EU: Returns
In 2016, Member States reported 305 365 
return decisions issued to third­country 
nationals as a result of an administra­
tive or judicial decision, which repre­
sented a 6.5% increase compared with 
2015. The absolute total number of mi­
grants subject to return decisions is still 
underestimated by this indicator, as data 
on decisions were unavailable from Aus­
tria, France, the Netherlands and Swe­
den till April 2016, which only reported 
effective returns1 but presumably issued 
a high number of decisions.
As in previous years, the number of 
return decisions was much larger than 
the total number of effective returns to 
third countries (176 223). The main rea­
sons for non­return relate to practical 
problems in the identification of return­
ees and in obtaining the necessary docu­
mentation from non­EU authorities. In 
addition, many decisions to return vol­
1 These Member States do not distinguish 
between decisions and effective returns 
and reported all as effective returns. 
untarily do not materialise as the persons 
decide to stay illegally. Some Member 
States reported that, over time, several 
return decisions have been issued to the 
same individuals. Although it is not pos­
sible to quantify the phenomenon, as 
data at EU level are anonymised, it illus­
trates the difficulty to effectively imple­
ment a return decision.
Finally, return decisions may also 
concern voluntary returns that are not 
registered. In fact, for voluntary return, 
only few Member States, such as the 
Netherlands, apply a policy of controlled 
departure. Under these circumstances, it 
is difficult to ascertain that a return de­
cision has effectively been implemented.
Within the number of effective re­
turns to third countries, 52% were re­
ported to be on a voluntary basis and 
45% were forced returns, while for the 
rest, the type of return was not specified.
In terms of nationalities, there is a 
striking difference between the nation­
alities detected crossing the border ille­
gally or staying illegally in the EU, and 
those effectively returned. Indeed, many 
detections of illegal border­crossing or 
even detections of illegal stay concern 
migrants who will apply for asylum and 
thus are not returned.
The European Commission noted in its 
communication on return policy that data 
on basic parameters (such as the average 
length of detention, grounds for deten­
tion, number of failed returns, and use 
of entry bans) proved to be only available 
from a limited number of Member States. 
Moreover, common definitions and ap­
proaches concerning data collection are 
frequently absent, impacting on the com­
parability of such data across the EU.
The number of effective returns may sometimes be larger than that of return decisions, as a return decision issued in a given month may be effectively enforced at a later date. Also, return decisions may be issued without 
prejudice to the person’s right to apply for asylum. Readmissions between Member States are not included (for example between France and Italy). Effective returns do not necessarily mean returns to the country of origin and, 
for example in the case of Syrians, they include returns of persons to third countries considered to be safe (for example from Hungary to Serbia)

Satellite phone calls
NGO SAR operations
6.1.  Long-range coast guarding operations in the Central 
Mediterranean
In 2016, the Central Mediterranean saw 
the highest number of migrant arrivals 
ever recorded from sub­Sahara, West Af­
rica and the Horn of Africa (181 459 mi­
grants, increase of 18% compared with 
2015). This trend, which is consistent 
with previous year­on­year increases, 
shows that the Central Mediterranean 
has become the main route for African 
migrants to the EU and it is very likely 
to remain so for the foreseeable future. 
Specifically, 89% of migrants arrived 
from Libya, making Italy the main en­
try point to the EU. As a result, most of 
the EU, civilian and NGO vessels in the 
region focused their Search and Rescue 
(SAR) activities on migrant boats depart­
ing from Libya.
Important changes were observed 
on this migratory route in 2016. Dur­
ing 2015, and the first months of 2016, 
smuggling groups instructed migrants 
to make satellite phone calls to the Mari­
time Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) 
in Rome to initiate targeted rescues on 
the high seas. SAR operations were 
mainly undertaken by Italian law­en­
forcement, EUNAVFOR Med or Frontex 
vessels with NGO vessels involved in less 
than 5% of the incidents. As shown in 
Figure 5, more than half of all rescue 
operations were initiated in this man­
ner. From June until October 2016, how­
ever, the pattern was reversed. Satellite 
phone calls to MRCC Rome decreased 
sharply to 10% and NGO rescue opera­
tions rose significantly to more than 
40% of all incidents.
Since June 2016, a significant number 
of boats were intercepted or rescued by 
NGO vessels without any prior distress 
call and without official information as 
to the rescue location. NGO presence 
and activities close to, and occasionally 
within, the 12­mile Libyan territorial wa­
ters nearly doubled compared with the 
previous year, totalling 15 NGO assets (14 
maritime and 1 aerial). In parallel, the 
overall number of incidents increased 
dramatically.
The statistical data show that the 
criminal networks behind illegal border­
crossings along the Central Mediterra­
nean route continued to exploit criminal 
business opportunities by handling a 
great demand for smuggling services and 
thus posed formidable challenges for EU 
border control. Libyan­based smugglers, 
in particular, heavily relied on the In­
ternational Convention for the Safety of 
Life at Sea (SOLAS), and associated SAR 
as well as humanitarian assistance ef­
forts, turning it into a distinct tactical 
advantage. This is not a new strategy, 
but the scope of the problem is alarming.
In this context, it transpired that both 
border surveillance and SAR missions 
close to, or within, the 12­mile territo­
rial waters of Libya have unintended 
consequences. Namely, they influence 
smugglers’ planning and act as a pull 
factor that compounds the difficulties 
inherent in border control and saving 
lives at sea. Dangerous crossings on un­
seaworthy and overloaded vessels were 
organised with the main purpose of be­
ing detected by EUNAVFOR Med / Frontex 
and NGO vessels.
Apparently, all parties involved in 
SAR operations in the Central Mediter­
ranean unintentionally help criminals 
achieve their objectives at minimum 
cost, strengthen their business model 
by increasing the chances of success. 
Migrants and refugees – encouraged by 
the stories of those who had successfully 
made it in the past – attempt the dan­
gerous crossing since they are aware of 
and rely on humanitarian assistance to 
reach the EU.
Closely related issues are the safety 
of migrants and refugees and, most sig­
nificantly, the increasing number of fa­
talities. According to UNHCR and IOM 
estimates, 2016 saw the largest number of 
migrant deaths on record in the Mediter­
ranean (5 083 compared with 3 777 in 2015 
and 3 279 in 2014).1 These, however, are 
only estimates, which also include the 
number of missing persons, since there 
is no system of recording the exact num­
ber of those who perish at sea. The esti­
mated total of dead and missing persons 
in the Central Mediterranean area was

4 579.2 The increasing number of migrant 
deaths, despite the enhanced EUNAVFOR 
Med / Frontex surveillance and NGO rescue 
efforts, seems paradoxical at first glance. 
The rising death toll mainly results from 
criminal activities aimed at making profit 
through the provision of smuggling ser­
vices at any cost. Libya­based smuggling 
groups became emboldened organising 
dangerous crossings on a daily basis us­
ing dilapidated vessels. Parallel smug­
gling operations continued during the 
winter in bad weather conditions expos­
ing migrants to even greater risks. Ruth­
less criminal behaviour disregarded even 
the most basic safety concerns exacerbat­
ing the difficulties inherent in conduct­
ing rescue operations in the unforgiving 
maritime environment.
The coordination of all parties in­
volved in SAR efforts represents an in­
2 Idem
creasing challenge. The more active role 
of NGO vessels carries important impli­
cations for border surveillance and SAR 
activities. 
It is worth noting here that the West­
ern African route – perhaps the most 
dangerous migration route – was closed 
thanks to an effective combination of 
border surveillance, return operations, 
and joint law­enforcement work with 
countries of origin / departure. This 
model represents one of the best ways 
to prevent a future migratory crisis in 
the Central Mediterranean.
In conclusion, SAR efforts will con­
tinue as long as the migratory crisis per­
sists in the Central Mediterranean not 
only because they relate to international 
legal obligations, but also because they 
stem from European values. SAR, how­
ever, requires increased coordination be­
tween all stakeholders to minimise the 
number of fatalities at sea as well as the 
unintended effects of operating so closely 
to Libyan territorial waters (pull factor). 
Specifically, all SAR operations should 
follow the same procedures, e.g. when it 
comes to the disposal of the vessels after 
the migrants have been rescued. Finally, 
since the reactive nature of long­range 
border surveillance and humanitarian 
missions does not address the causal fac­
tors underpinning migratory and refu­
gee movements, the situation calls for 
more sustainable policies and measures – 
in African countries of origin and transit 
(especially Libya) – to provide safer and 
legal routes to refugees and reduce mi­
gratory flows towards the EU.

6.2.  Iranians travelling undetected into the EU with fraudulent 
documents – a case study
Despite the lifting of international sanc­
tions, the asylum claims lodged in 2016 
by Iranian nationals in the EU increased 
by 50% compared with 2015 with Ger­
many and the UK reporting the major­
ity of applications. Significantly, the 
number of Iranian asylum claims has ex­
ceeded the number of illegal border­cross­
ings by Iranians in the last two years.
It is worth noting that Iranian nation­
als represent one of the largest groups of 
inadequately documented passengers ar­
riving at UK airports. The use of various 
air routes and multiple documents indi­
cates the involvement of criminal net­
works. Based on EDF data, document 
and identity fraud by Iranian nationals 
remains high despite a slight temporary 
decrease between May and August 2016. 
Nevertheless, the long­term increase 
in document fraud detections observed 
since EDF data collection began in 2009, 
has become more pronounced since the 
last quarter of 2015.
Approximately 28% of Iranian nation­
als detected on arrival to the EU / Schen­
gen area in possession of fraudulent 
documents travel via third countries. 
This share is declining compared with 
the number of detections on intra­
EU / Schengen movements. In the pe­
riod January­October 2016 many cases 
of Iranian nationals with fraudulent 
documents were reported by Spain, Aus­
tria, Germany, Italy and Denmark. Re­
gardless of their final EU destination,

most Iranians with fraudulent docu­
ments departed either from Iran or Tur­
key. Many detections at smaller Spanish 
airports indicate that Iranian nationals 
did not reach these airports directly from 
Iran but indirectly via Turkish airports or 
via more complex and expensive routes 
transiting, for example, South Ameri­
can countries.
Approximately 70% of all Iranian­
related document fraud cases in 2016 
involved secondary (i.e. intra­EU / Schen­
gen) movements, the majority of which 
were detected between the Schengen 
area and the UK. Member States detected 
around 500 Iranians on their way to­
wards the UK. 
Apart from the UK, an increasing 
number of Iranian holders of fraudulent 
documents detected on intra­EU / Schen­
gen routes were heading to Germany. 
This pattern is consistent with the re­
cord number of Iranians who have ap­
plied for asylum in Germany over the 
past few months.

6.3.  Personal data for risk analysis – 
mixed methods analysis of smuggling 
networks in Libya
In February 2016, Frontex launched a 
Pilot Project (called Processing Personal 
Data for Risk Analysis – PeDRA) in the 
framework of the EPN JO Triton 2016, 
with the aim of processing information 
containing personal data collected dur­
ing interviews with newly arrived mi­
grants in the Central Mediterranean. In 
2016, some 2 400 newly arrived migrants 
were interviewed in Italy by Frontex 
Guest Officers deployed from EU Mem­
ber States.
Quantitative data analysis
The sample
In 2016, nearly 50 nationalities of newly­
arrived migrants were interviewed after 
arriving in Italy, which demonstrates 
the variety of source countries contrib­
uting to the migration flow. The most 
commonly interviewed migrants were 
unmarried (68%) males (92%) travelling 
alone (59%) from countries such as Eri­
trea and the Gambia, followed by Sudan, 
Somalia and Nigeria – together account­
ing for 44% of all interviews. The young­
est migrants tended to be from Guinea 
and Mali (22 years old on average) and the 
oldest were from Syria and Palestine (~31 
and ~36, respectively). Nearly all inter­
viewed migrants claimed to have friends 
or family who were already in the EU.
The migration process
Nearly two­thirds of all migrants inter­
viewed in the Central Mediterranean 
region claimed to have left their home 
country for economic reasons, with the 
remainder citing conflict as their main 
push factor. Correspondingly, most of 
the interviewed migrants were coming 
to the EU for economic reasons and em­
ployment possibilities, followed by ac­
cess to the asylum procedure.
The most common final destination 
country was Italy, followed by Germany, 
France, Spain and the UK. Some na­
tionalities expressed very clear prefer­
ences. For example, the most commonly 
claimed final destination country for Er­
itreans was the UK, whereas most inter­
viewed Nigerians quoted Italy as their 
final destination. Migrants from Soma­
lia, on the other hand, were equally ea­
ger to get to Germany, Italy or Sweden. 
Overall, Syrians tended to be headed for 
Germany, especially the well­educated 
ones. Such clear preference towards cer­
tain final destination countries are likely 
to be linked to already established dias­
poras acting as a pull factor.
People-smuggling networks
In total, a staggering 96% of newly­ar­
rived migrants interviewed in the Cen­
tral Mediterranean region stated that 
they had used the services of smug­
gling networks to enter the EU illegally 
(Fig. 7). This is significant because it sug­
gests that irregular migration via Libya 
is entirely dependent on the services pro­
vided by the smuggling networks. Given 
the very high number of arrivals in 2016, 
it is not unreasonable to assume that 
smuggling networks are amassing vast 
financial capital, averaging USD 5 000 
per migrant in peak months. It is also 
an important finding because it implies 
that any activity that would disrupt or 
deter the smuggling networks could re­
sult in a vastly reduced flow of irregular 
migrants into the EU.
Moreover, 70% of migrants inter­
viewed within the EPN JO Triton 2016 
specifically stated that the reason why 
they decided to enter the EU illegally via 
Figure 7. A staggering 96% of interviewed migrants newly arrived in the Central Mediterranean region (JO Triton 2016)

Libya was the availability of smuggling 
services in that country (Fig. 8). This per­
centage rose to nearly 80% for migrants 
from far­afield countries, such as Pa­
kistan and Iraq, who are clearly choos­
ing to target the EU from Libya because 
of the readily available facilitation ser­
vices. Even though several thousand mi­
grants were interviewed, not one spoke 
about difficulties in locating smuggling 
networks. On the contrary, they tended 
to be inundated with offers from differ­
ent networks.
The correlation between the nation­
alities of the migrants and of the peo­
ple smugglers they used is illustrated in 
a network diagram in Figure 9. The dia­
gram is predictably dominated by Libyan 
people smugglers. As a result, almost all 
migrants were facilitated to some extent 
by Libyans, and Syrian migrants were 
almost exclusively facilitated by Libyan 
people smugglers, probably because of 
the shared language. Other nationali­
ties tended to use compatriots such as 
Sudanese migrants facilitated by Suda­
nese people smugglers; similar trends 
can be seen for Moroccans and Gambi­
ans. The exception was migrants from 
Somalia who were more commonly fa­
cilitated by people smugglers from Su­
dan than by their compatriots.
It is clear that a very large number of 
people smugglers are involved in facili­
tating irregular migration from a wide 
range of locations towards Libya and on­
wards to the EU. Somalian people smug­
glers were reported to be active not only 
in their home country and in Libya but 
also in Ethiopia, South Sudan and even 
in Kenya and Uganda. Similarly, Eritrean 
people smugglers were active not only in 
Libya but also in Ethiopia and Sudan. By 
contrast, Sudanese and Nigerian people 
smugglers only appeared to be active in 
Libya and their home country. What is 
clear is that a very wide range of nation­
alities are involved in facilitating irregu­
lar migration towards Libya and onwards 
to the EU in numerous locations.
Figure 8. Some 70% of interviewed migrants newly arrived in the Central Mediterranean area, stated that access to 
facilitation services was the reason for entering the EU via this route. Note differences in sample sizes

by Libyan smugglers, whereas Senegalese migrants mostly used the services

6.4.  Identifying return system 
vulnerabilities
In its preamble, the new European Bor­
der and Coast Guard Regulation1 stipu­
lates that the Agency should step up its 
assistance to Member States in returning 
third­country nationals to whom nega­
tive asylum decisions have been issued or 
who have no right to stay. In particular, 
the Agency shall coordinate and organ­
ise return operations from one or more 
Member States and organise and con­
duct return interventions to reinforce 
the return systems of Member States. 
Moreover, the general and tailored risk 
analyses conducted by the Agency shall 
also extend to the field of return.
Level of returns nearly unchanged 
in spite of migration crisis
In spite of the massive irregular move­
ments into the EU between September 
2015 and March 2016, the overall level of 
effective returns to third countries per­
formed by EU Member States has not 
1 Regulation (EU) 2016/1624 of the 
European Parliament and of the Council 
of 14 September 2016 on the European 
Border and Coast Guard
increased significantly. The number of 
people effectively removed from the EU 
remained stable with a monthly average 
of less than 15 000 in 2016, which is a 
level similar to previous years. In fact, 
the monthly figures and their break­
downs did not show any change at the 
beginning of 2016, when many of the mi­
grants or asylum seekers who had arrived 
in 2015 became subject to return (due to 
a failed asylum claim or illegal stay).
In spite of a rapidly rising number 
of negative asylum decisions following 
the irregular migration peak of 2015, the 
number of return decisions issued by EU 
Member States in 2016 increased by only 
6.5% compared with a year before. 
However, substantial differences were 
noticed between Member States. Greece 
and Italy, being the main entry points 
for irregular migration to the EU, re­
ported numbers of effective returns that 
were approximately 10% lower than in 
2015. At the same time, main EU desti­
nation countries of the irregular migra­
tion flows in 2016 reported substantially 
higher numbers than in 2015. In 2016, 
Germany increased its effective returns 
to third countries by 24%. Western Bal­
kan nationals accounted for 90% of these 
effective returns. However, other mi­
grant nationalities with high first­in­
stance asylum rejection rates were 
seriously underrepresented as regards 
the number of effective returns. For ex­
ample, a two­digit number of Pakistani 
nationals was returned from Germany in 
2016, while the reported number of Pa­
kistani asylum applications doubled to 
over 14 000 and the first­instance asy­
lum rejection rate of Pakistani nation­
als was high.
In 2016, Sweden was among the coun­
tries with the most significant increase 
in effective returns with a 55% growth 
compared with 2015. The change was 
mainly due to a more than six­fold in­
crease in returns of Iraqi nationals and 
a 15­fold increase in effective returns 
of Afghan nationals to approximately 
1 000. Also, Poland substantially accel­
erated its effective returns – especially 
those of Ukrainian nationals – to more 
than 15 000 (a 50% increase).

Frontex · Risk Analysis for 2017
Differences in return levels 
between different regions of 
origin
Moreover, EU­wide data on effective 
returns show substantial differences 
between regions of origin of irregular mi­
grants. This is clearly illustrated through 
a comparison between nationalities from 
the Western Balkans and West Africa. 
Nationals of both regions show average 
first­instance asylum rejection rates of 
more than 70% and a comparably high 
irregular migration pressure to the EU.
As illustrated by Figure 10, the rising 
number of irregular migrants from the 
Western Balkans detected in the EU seems 
to have led to a slightly increased number 
of effective returns. This could be due to a 
relatively good level of cooperation with 
Western Balkan countries in terms of legal 
and practical return requirements. In ad­
dition, the fact that a number of EU Mem­
ber States and the European Commission 
have designated Western Balkan countries 
as ‘safe countries of origin’ has contributed 
to the acceleration of return procedures.
By contrast, the strong increase in il­
legal border­crossings of West African na­
tionals in 2016 did not lead to an increase 
in effective returns. The fact that peaks in 
irregular migration are not fully reflected 
in the number of returns can be associated 
with: gaps in Member States’ regulations 
and legislative frameworks; national pro­
cedures to process asylum applications and 
return decisions; and difficulties in collab­
orating effectively with the countries of or­
igin in the identification process.
This is particularly relevant for smaller 
West African countries, which have a 
rather limited network of consular offices 
in the EU. The return procedure is thus 
slowed down due to numerous practical 
obstacles, especially difficulties in obtain­
ing adequate travel documents from the 
authorities of countries of origin. Return 
agreements between Member States and 
countries of origin are an essential pre­
condition for implementing effective re­
turns. Since cooperation of countries of 
origin may be problematic, certain Mem­
ber States have developed special strate­
gies and operational measures. These best 
practices include setting up task forces; 
developing cross­departmental cooper­
ation frameworks; and implementing 
practical initiatives with partner coun­
tries such as the European Integrated Re­
turn Management Initiative (EURINT).
Yet another effective practice is iden­
tification missions. They involve the is­
suance of necessary documentation by 
officials of countries of origin based in 
Member States to returnees of their own 
nationality. Since enhanced cooperation 
between Member States is indispensa­
ble in dealing with countries of origin, 
Member States share identification mis­
sions to ensure effective readmissions.
Development of solutions to 
improve the return system 
requires advance time
A common element of the aforemen­
tioned solutions is that they require con­
siderable time for planning and practical 
implementation. For this reason, regu­
lar and detailed analysis of the EU return 
system with a view to forecasting future 
return priorities would accelerate the 
necessary preparatory work and help im­
prove cooperation with countries of or­
igin in a timely manner. Also, it would 
assist in identifying best practices in 
regard to their legislative and adminis­
trative framework, international coop­
eration, and voluntary return projects 
and in sharing them among Member 
States. Moreover, it would help identify 
vulnerabilities in the EU return system.
The analysis of return data reveals sig­
nificant differences between national re­
turn systems, especially in terms of their 
performance in dealing with specific 
countries of origin with high asylum re­
jection rates. Return data also show that 
irregular migrants with low chances for 
a positive asylum decision already exploit 
the existing gaps in Member States’ re­
turn systems, such as a lack of bilateral 
cooperation and readmission agreements 
with the respective countries of origin.

6.5.  Safety and security situation in 
reception centres
The unprecedented migratory flows to the 
EU via the Eastern and Central Mediterra­
nean routes over the past two years have 
led to a dramatic increase in the number 
of detections of illegal border­crossings 
(503 700 in 2016 and 1 820 000 in 2015)1 and 
first­time asylum seekers applying for in­
ternational protection (1 255 640 in 2015 
compared with 562 680 in 2014)2 – the main 
nationalities being Iraqi, Afghan and Syr­
ian. The ongoing migratory crisis has been 
particularly challenging for Greece and It­
aly, as they are the main entry points for 
the massive irregular migration flow to­
wards the EU. To address these challenges, 
the ‘Hotspot’ approach was adopted as a 
more orderly way to manage dispropor­
tionate migratory pressures at the EU’s 
external borders. Hotspot centres serve 
the purpose of identification, registration, 
fingerprinting, debriefing, processing of 
asylum requests and return operations. 
In the performance of these tasks, front­
line Member States are assisted by EASO, 
Frontex and Eurojust. It should be empha­
sised here that the management of recep­

Switzerland until October 2016.
tion centres and the protection of migrants 
and refugees is an exclusive responsibility 
of EU Member States.3
As shown in Table 2, Greek Hotspots 
have significantly larger capacity than 
Italian ones, which is consistent with 
the migratory patterns over the last two 
years. According to the Greek authori­
ties, the actual number of migrants ac­
commodated on the five islands at the 
end of 2016 was 15 431.4 This reflects a 
dynamically changing situation as the 
migrants and refugees accommodated 
in these sites stay until the completion 
of registration and processing of their 
asylum requests. Out of the total, 9 918 
(64%) were accommodated in Hotspots 
and 4 787 (31%) in UNHCR and other non­
governmental facilities.
On four of the Greek Hotspot islands 
(with the exception of Leros) insuffi­
cient capacity to cater for the actual ac­
commodation needs was reported. The 
situation on Chios was particularly chal­
lenging, as the overall number of persons 
in governmental and non­governmen­
tal reception facilities was three times 
higher than the existing Hotspot ca­
pacity. Overall, 62 784 people were ac­
commodated in reception sites in the 
Greek mainland and on the islands by 
the end of 2016. However, according to 
UNHCR data, the overall accommoda­
tion capacity of the country amounts for 
approximately 35 000 people only.5 This 
means that a large number of persons 
were staying in other than government­
run hosting facilities (e.g. apartments, 
buildings, hotels, hosting families, and

makeshift camps). Hence, there exists 
a pressing need for additional reception 
centres, as the current capacity has been 
exceeded considerably.
The accommodation of significant 
numbers of people in Hotspots and other 
reception centres has drawn attention 
to the safety and security concerns in 
these sites.6 Statistical data regarding 
the safety and security situation in EU 
Hotspots, and other hosting facilities, 
are not systematically collected. Never­
theless, Frontex as well as UNHCR and 
NGOs have been regularly reporting on 
reception conditions identifying various 
weaknesses. Many, if not all, of the iden­
tified issues have some bearing on the 
safety and security situation.
As a case in point, several riots took 
place in Greek Hotspots in 2016 resulting 
in injuries and material damage. Among 
others, the riot and fire at Moria Hotspot 
on Lesbos Island on 19 September 2016 re­
quired intervention by the anti­riot po­
lice to restore order and the fire brigade 
to extinguish the fire. Tensions in the 
facility arose in connection to its over­
crowding. At the time, it accommodated 
more than 4 000 people, which was way 
beyond its maximum capacity. 
Bulgaria’s largest Harmanli Refugee 
Camp and other camps it Elhovo, Ly­
ubmets and Sofia experienced similar 
security and capacity problems. On 24 
November 2016, unrest broke out in Har­
manli in response to the imposition of 
a quarantine on the camp following an 
outbreak of an infectious skin disease 
and concerns about its possible spread 
among the local population. This site 
has a capacity of 2 700 and at the time 
housed 3 000 residents. During the riot, 
2 000 refugees clashed with the police 
leaving 24 officers injured. These events 
in Greece and Bulgaria highlighted the 
tense and unstable situation in reception

sites and the precarious situation of mi­
grants and refugees.
The aforementioned issues were not 
limited to the main entry points at the 
EU’s external borders, but also affected 
other sites along the main routes lead­
ing to the final destination countries. 
Many security incidents, widely reported 
in the media, took place in makeshift 
camps at specific extra­ and intra­EU bor­
der sections (e.g. Idomeni camp close to 
the border between Greece and the for­
mer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia bor­
der, ferry and Channel Tunnel terminals 
in Calais, France) and hosting sites in 
certain destination countries (e.g. Ger­
many) requiring constant police presence 
and interventions to restore and main­
tain order. As a result, refugee camps 
such as the ‘Jungle’ in Calais and Ido­
meni in Northern Greece were eventu­
ally shut down by the authorities.
In general, the control of reception 
centres poses significant challenges for 
the following reasons:
 <U+25AA> The large influx of migrants and ref­
ugees creates, among others, a need 
for public­order policing and crowd 
control that falls outside the remit 
of border­control authorities, which 
are neither equipped nor trained for 
such actions. In certain cases, there is 
a need to deploy special police units to 
enforce order, avoid spill­over effects 
and alleviate feelings of fear among 
local populations.
 <U+25AA> The arrival of numerous children (ac­
companied and unaccompanied) and 
female migrants and refugees indi­
cates the need to take special pro­
tection measures to protect these 
vulnerable groups from gender­based 
violence, THB and sexual crimes (e.g. 
separate accommodation, provision 
of medical and psychological assis­
tance). According to UNHCR data, 
37% of all arrivals in Greece (includ­
ing 2 300 unaccompanied children) 
and 16% in Italy in 2016 involved chil­
dren, while the percentages for fe­
males were 21% and 13%, respectively.7
 <U+25AA> Riots and fights between groups of 
migrants and refugees frequently 
take place in Hotspots. Such inci­
dents are mainly triggered by frus­
tration over substandard conditions, 
prolonged registration and processing 
of asylum requests, spreading of ru­
mours and uncertainty about their fu­
ture. During these events, the safety 
of Hotspot staff and deployed guest 
officers is at risk. Another cause of 
clashes among migrants involves the 
mixing of different ethnicities and 
cultures. In particular, as a group 
with distinct socio­cultural and reli­
gious background, Afghan migrants 
were over­represented among nation­
als involved in incidents in the recep­
tion centres.
 <U+25AA> Reception conditions that do not meet 
minimum standards (e.g. poor san­
itation, hygiene, heating, food, and 
overcrowding) represent the most fre­
quent causes of unrest. Even within 
the same country living conditions

Update; available at http://data.unhcr.
org/mediterranean/country.php?id=105
may vary between reception sites. 
These factors exacerbate tensions re­
sulting in violent acts, material dam­
ages and serious harm.
 <U+25AA> Reception facilities attract the atten­
tion of people smugglers, human traf­
fickers and terrorist recruiters. Since 
this carries serious implications for 
public order, the authorities need to 
exercise constant vigilance to pre­
vent and suppress criminal and ter­
rorist radicalisation activities. The 
case of Anis Amri, a rejected asylum 
seeker from Tunisia who carried out 
a terrorist attack in Berlin, Germany 
on 19 December 2016, is indicative of 
how problems can arise affecting the 
internal security of Member States.
 <U+25AA> Finally, the situation within recep­
tion centres coupled with concerns 
about large migratory flows can also 
influence the perceptions and atti­
tudes of the general public towards 
migrants and refugees. Improving 
the safety and security in these sites 
could go a long way in improving re­
lations with local communities and 
preventing any xenophobic reactions 
and hate crimes against migrants and 
refugees.
In conclusion, the current situation 
in frontline Hotspots and other host­
ing facilities needs improvement be­
cause it affects the safety of migrants 
and refugees as well as the internal se­
curity of Member States. Overall, better 
management of reception centres is re­
quired as an integral part of EU migra­
tion management.

Frontex · Risk Analysis for 2017
6.6.  Prohibited goods with possible 
security impacts
The Frontex Risk Analysis Unit together 
with participants of the Western Balkans 
Risk Analysis Network agreed to engage 
in regular data collection regarding fire­
arms possession and smuggling cases 
detected by the respective border police 
forces. The data collection aims to create 
a better understanding of the interna­
tional dimension of firearms smuggling 
and come up with more efficient solu­
tions through a coherent and concerted 
regional approach. This is the first such 
initiative amongst the risk analysis net­
works coordinated by Frontex that sets in 
motion a statistical data exchange mech­
anism on firearms detections.
Provisional definitions, indicators 
and a standardised reporting template 
were created to collect relevant infor­
mation on cases of firearms detections. 
Subsequently, information covering the 
year 2015 was collected at a special work­
shop. The process then continued with 
monthly reporting by participating coun­
tries throughout 2016.
Generally low detections at the 
borders in 2016
In the first ten months of 2016, the 
border police forces of the six Western 
Balkan countries continued to detect 
weapons (i.e. firearms, gas and con­
verted) and ammunition.
Specifically, the regional reporting 
covered 134 cases in which 154 weap­
ons (i.e. 115 firearms, 38 gas weapons, 
and one converted) and 13 741 rounds of 
ammunition were detected. Compared 
with the same period of 2015, there were 
approximately 34% more ammunition 
pieces, 77% more firearms and 36% less 
gas weapons. In 2016, only one converted 
weapon and one optical targeting device 
were detected (no grenades or explosive 
material) whereas in 2015 six converted 
weapons, two optical targeting devices, 
two grenades and 3.45 kilograms of ex­
plosive material were detected. Hence, 
the number of detections was quite low 
given the total length of regional bor­
der areas.
With regard to firearms, there were 
62 handguns (i.e. pistols, revolvers), 43 
long rifles (or shotguns) and 10 auto­
matic weapons. Out of the 38 gas weap­
ons detected, there were 33 handguns 
(no details available on the remaining 
five detections).
Most detections occurred at BCPs
In the 10­month reporting period, most 
detections occurred at BCPs. These in­
cluded 12  863 rounds of ammunition 
(mainly at the borders between Serbia 
and Hungary, Albania and Kosovo*, Ser­
bia and the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia, and between Serbia and Cro­
atia), 100 firearms (mainly at the border 
sections of Serbia­Croatia, Bosnia and 
Herzegovina­Croatia, Serbia­Hungary 
and Serbia­Bulgaria), 25 gas weapons 
(mostly at the border sections of Serbia 
with Hungary and Bulgaria), one con­
verted weapon and a rifle scope.
The authorities also detected eight 
firearms, 13 gas weapons and 298 pieces 
of ammunition in their jurisdictions but 
not in the immediate vicinity of their 
borders. Also, two firearms and 53 am­
munition pieces were reported at the 
green border (likely linked to unlicensed 
hunters). Moreover, five firearms and 529 
rounds of ammunition were detected by 
border police forces outside their area 
of responsibility (i.e. more than 30 km 
inland).
During the first ten months of 2016, 
130 persons were detected in possession 
of the prohibited items. The majority (82) 
were citizens of Western Balkan coun­
tries, followed by EU nationals (29), 
Turks (12) and third­country nation­
als  (5). The nationality of two persons 
was unknown. In seven cases, the items 
were found hidden in common train 
compartments or abandoned in the vi­
cinity of borders thus they could not be 
linked to specific individuals.
Large-scale case reported in the 
media
According to open source information, 
the Serbian national police arrested ten 
individuals in relation to a major fire­
arms case in the towns of Apatin and 
Sombor. The police seized 100 hand gre­
nades, 30 kilograms of explosives, two 
anti­armour grenades, 12 rocket launch­
ers, eight assault rifles, a heavy machine 
gun, 6 000 ammunition pieces, as well 
as detonators and semi­automatic rifles. 
This was the largest seizure of weapons 
in Serbia in 15 years.

7.  Conclusions
45 of 60
Frontex · Risk Analysis for 2017
Given the sustained migratory pressure 
at the external borders, it is evident that 
the pressing challenge for border­control 
authorities is to solve the conundrum of 
reconciling two vexing issues. On the 
one hand, there is a need for increased 
SAR operations, which unwittingly cre­
ate conditions whereby smugglers are 
putting migrants’ lives at risk to boost 
their profits. On the other hand, it is 
necessary to introduce effective preven­
tion measures to relieve the pressure at 
the borders. While concrete measures 
will ultimately depend on the types of 
migratory flows and the political situa­
tion in the last country of departure, the 
solution will require a combination of 
rapid and efficient coast guard actions, 
measures in and with third countries, 
as well as enhanced return operations. 
With the difficulties associated with 
proper screening and registration of a 
large number of arrivals, there is a risk 
that persons posing a security threat may 
be en tering the EU. Several tragic events 
within the EU have also demonstrated 
that border management has an impor­
tant security component.
Second­line checks on arrival are a 
crucial step in the identification process. 
They also provide an important source of 
information which can be further used 
for intelligence and risk analysis pur­
poses. Improving intelligence and an­
alytical capacities is thus also of great 
significance.
The increased number of reported vul­
nerable persons at the border also makes 
it very clear that the effective detection 
of people trafficked for sexual exploita­
tion, forced labour and other purposes 
remains a major challenge for border 
authorities. In fact, victims themselves 
are often not aware of their fate when 
they arrive in the transit or destination 
countries.
One improvement which has been 
evident in the preceding years is the in­
creasing pool of sources of informa tion 
and data from the external borders. In­
formation is key for situational moni­
toring and analytical purposes, thus the 
improved availability of infor mation is 
of critical importance. How ever, with 
a greater amount of information comes 
a greater challenge in utilising it effec­
tively. This is especially true in emer­
gency situations when large amounts 
of information are available but time is 
scarce. Therefore, data and situational 
information are some times not enough, 
so authorities will require the analysis 
and intelligence de rived from them to 
make fully in formed decisions. The man­
agement of this knowledge­generation 
process is critical.
Regular passenger flows across exter­
nal borders will also grow signifi cantly 
in the coming years, in particu lar at the 
air border, due to increased global mo­
bility. Visa liberalisation processes and 
local border traffic agreements also lead 
to greater responsibility for border­con­
trol authorities. Movements across ex­
ternal air borders are managed through 
a layered approach, where the border 
is divided into four tiers. In this con­
text, the physical border is gradually 
becoming a second ary layer for risk as­
sessment, meaning that checking and 
screening start well before passengers 
cross border­control posts at airports. 
Border management will be increasingly 
risk­based to en sure that interventions 
are focused on high­risk movements of 
people, while low­risk movements are 
processed smoothly.
Col laboration with Customs vary 
widely across EU Member States but is 
essential in tackling a range of criminal 
activities, from detecting migrants con­
cealed in vehicles, to preventing smug­
gling of excise goods, weapons and 
drugs. In addition, collaboration with 
police and judicial au thorities is also im­
portant to develop more effective and ef­
ficient border­control activities.

Notes on FRAN data sources and methods 
The term ‘Member States’ refers to FRAN 
Member States, which includes the 28 
Member States and the three Schengen 
Associated Countries (Iceland, Norway 
and Switzerland). For the data concern­
ing detections at the external borders of 
the EU, some of the border types are not 
applicable to all FRAN Member States. 
This pertains to data on all FRAN in­
dicators since the data are provided 
disaggregated by border type. The def­
initions of detections at land borders 
are therefore not applicable (excluding 
borders with non­Schengen principali­
ties) for Belgium, the Czech Republic, 
Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland, 
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the 
Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Swit­
zerland and the UK. For Cyprus, the 
land border refers to the Green Line 
demarcation with the area where the 
Government of the Republic of Cyprus 
does not exercise effective control. For 
sea borders, the definitions are not ap­
plicable for land­locked Member States 
including Austria, the Czech Republic, 
Hungary, Luxembourg, Slovakia and 
Switzerland. 
In addition, data on detections of il­
legal border­crossing at land, air and sea 
BCPs (1B) are not available for Iceland, 
Ireland and Spain, and in Greece these 
detections are included in the data for 
indicator 1A. 
Data on detections of illegal border­
crossing between sea BCPs (1A) are not 
available for Ireland. For 2013, data from 
Slovenia include detections at the EU ex­
ternal borders only until June 2013. 
Data on apprehension (FRAN Indi­
cator 2) of facilitators are not available 
for Ireland and UK. For Italy, the data 
are not disaggregated by border type, 
but are reported as total apprehensions 
(not specified). Data for Italy and Nor­
way also include the facilitation of ille­
gal stay and work. For Romania, the data 
include land Intra­EU detections on exit 
at the border with Hungary. 
For the data concerning detections 
of illegal stay (FRAN Indicator 3), data 
on detections on exit are not available 
for Ireland, Italy and the UK. Data on 
detections of illegal stay inland have 
not been available from the Netherlands 
since 2012. 
Data on refusals of entry (FRAN In­
dicator 4) at the external EU borders are 
not disaggregated by reason of refusal 
for Ireland and the UK. 
The data on passenger flow (shared on 
voluntary basis) are not available for Aus­
tria, Ireland, Sweden and the UK. Data 
on passenger flow at the air border are 
not available according to the definition 
for Spain. Data at the sea border are not 
available for Cyprus, Malta, Spain, the 
Netherlands, Romania and Denmark. 
For all indicators, data from Croatia 
are available only starting with July 2013.
