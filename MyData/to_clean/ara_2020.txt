Frontex · Risk Analysis for 2020
1. Foreword
Comprehensive situational awareness 
for the European Border and Coast Guard 
means that we must consider various 
developments, starting with those far 
beyond our external borders. Some meas-
ures, such as these under the common 
visa policy, have immediate and straight-
forward impact. Much else in terms of 
developments that impact EU border 
management is beyond our control – nat-
ural disasters, conflict and level of eco-
nomic development.
Closer to our borders, in the direct 
EU neighbourhood, the impact of meas-
ures taken by the respective authorities 
makes the difference between uncon-
trolled large-scale migratory move-
ments and manageable conditions. At 
the external borders is where we col-
lectively secure the Schengen area. Fi-
nally, within the area of free movement, 
our collective response, such as the re-
turn of people who are residing within 
the EU illegally, is also to be consid-
ered (the last tier of the ‘four-tier ac-
cess control model’). The Frontex Risk 
Analysis should pro vide reliable infor-
mation covering all of the aspects rele-
vant to the European integrated border 
management. Only with this situa-
tional awareness we may safeguard the 
European Area of Freedom, Security 
and Justice.
With this in mind, I would like to 
present the Frontex Risk Analysis for 2020, 
which provides a comprehensive picture 
of the European Union’s migratory sit-
uation. This, as always, is anchored by 
a series of indicators from the previous 
year. These show that while the detec-
tion of illegal border-crossings between 
border-crossing points has gone down 
to the lowest level since 2013, other in-
dicators, such as refusal of entry and de-
tections of persons staying illegally, rose 
from the previous year.
While the first part of Risk Analysis for 
2020 focuses on migratory issues, the re-
port also discusses other challenges for 
border management and Frontex – pan-
demics, terrorism and various types of 
cross-border crime. These include ille-
gal firearms, drug trafficking and sto-
len vehicles.
Risk Analysis for 2020 also features special 
analyses that touch upon other core func-
tions of Frontex. They include the effect 
of Frontex’s new mandate in the area of 
returns or changes in the way criminal 
smuggling networks have been operat-
ing and tracking the movement of ter-
rorists. Other interesting topics analysed 
by our experts are security risks of black-
listed flag vessels and secondary move-
ments by sea.
We also present an integrated asy-
lum-migration picture Frontex prepared 
together with the European Asylum Sup-
port Office (EASO) and Europol, which

highlights our cooperation with other EU 
agencies to support their stakeholders.
Finally, Risk Analysis for 2020 reviews 
the possible evolution of the situation 
along the external borders of the EU in 
the coming years. Among the challenges 
foreseen by Frontex are the effects of pan-
demics and migrants organising them-
selves or being used to challenge border 
regimes. Other potential challenges in-
clude the possibility of a trend reversal 
in the number of irregular arrivals and 
a possible change of the upward trend 
of passenger flows.
In a timely study, our experts ana-
lyse and provide actionable information 
about the effect of pandemics on border 
control and the role of Frontex in sup-
porting Member States. The health crisis 
has brought to the forefront the need for 
a common situational picture provided 
by the Agency. It also spotlights the es-
sential role of an integrated approach to 
effective border management to protect 
health while preserving the integrity of 
the EU/Schengen area.
The recent events at the Greek bor-
ders highlight the fact that we must 
remain vigilant and maintain compre-
hensive situational awareness. Fron-
tex and Member States must continue 
to cooperate to uphold a clear picture 
of the trends in migration, cross-bor-
der crime and other phenomena at the 
external borders.
These combined risks make even more 
urgent the establishment of the European 
Border and Coast Guard standing corps, 
with staff and equipment able to rein-
force Member States and to strengthen 
EU responsiveness capacities.
This will be a game changer for Eu-
ropean border management that will be 
a crucial part of future responses to desta-
bilisation linked to challenges such as hy-
brid threats and pandemics.
The responsibility for the external bor-
ders of the European Union and Schengen 
Area is in the hands of Member States and 
Frontex. Together our aim is to ensure ef-
fective borders addressing the challenges 
of irregular migration, cross-border crime 
or terrorism. This way we want to contrib-
ute to a well-functioning European area 
of Freedom, Security and Justice.

Frontex · Risk Analysis for 2020
2. Summary
The total number of reported detections 
of illegal border-crossing along the EU’s 
external borders fell in 2019 to the low-
est level since 2013. The observed irreg-
ular migration patterns did not deviate 
greatly from previous years, so grouping 
illegal border-crossings into chiefly the 
Western, Central and Eastern Mediterra-
nean routes continues to be instructive. 
On the EU’s eastern borders as well as 
on the circular route from Albania south-
wards into the EU, the lowest numbers 
were reported since the Frontex Risk 
Analysis Network started collecting data. 
However, the relative decrease in 2019 
compared with previous years was mostly 
due to a drop in migrants intercepted and 
rescued in the Central and Western Med-
iterranean. In contrast, detections on the 
Eastern Mediterranean, Western Balkan 
and Western African routes recorded sig-
nificantly higher numbers of detections 
compared with 2018. 
The reversal in the long-term trend of 
growing migratory pressure on the West-
ern Mediterranean route, which occurred 
in the spring of 2019, was perhaps the 
least expected and arguably most con-
sequential factor as regards the EU’s ex-
ternal border overall.
The spotlight once again returned to 
the Eastern Aegean in 2019, where mi-
gratory pressure rose in the spring and 
peaked in September, after which arriv-
als started falling chiefly due to weather 
conditions. In the second half of the year, 
arrivals on the Eastern Mediterranean sea 
route were the highest since the signing 
of the EU-Turkey Statement. Migrant 
smugglers managed to provide for the 
increased demand, in particular from 
Afghan and Syrian migrants coordinat-
ing simultaneous departures. Push fac-
tors throughout many key countries of 
origin and long-term host countries in-
tensified as the year progressed. The pres-
sure on Turkey’s land border with the EU 
subsided slightly in 2019. Cyprus experi-
enced a significant increase of migrants 
crossing the green line and, in the lat-
ter half of the year, sporadically arriv-
ing by sea.
Irregular migration towards the EU 
along the two main migratory corridors 
through the Western Balkans – the Greek-
Albanian corridor and the Serbian-cen-
tred corridor – continued throughout 
2019. The western corridor into Albania 
reported mounting detections after the 
start of the Frontex joint operation in 
May. In the second half of the year the 
pressure from the region northwards 
focused on the EU borders with Serbia. 
Detections on this route grew by 158% 
compared to 2018.
After January 2019 departures from 
Morocco on the Western Mediterranean 
route decreased significantly (by 57% 
compared with 2018 as regards the sea 
route). Meanwhile departures from Mo-
rocco on the Western African route in-
creased again slightly. Migration pressure 
on the Algerian corridor to the EU sea-
sonally ticked up in the autumn, as in 
previous years.
On the Central Mediterranean route, 
the Libyan corridor saw relatively little 
activity throughout 2019. Of the main 
nationalities departing from Libya, Er-
itreans saw the largest relative and ab-
solute decrease. Detections on the other 
corridors that make up this migratory 
route also decreased compared with 2018.
On the Eastern Land Border in 2019, 
illegal border-crossings from each of 
the EU’s eastern neighbours decreased. 
However, refusals of entry on the east-
ern green border on the other hand con-
tinued to rise. On the circular route from 
Albania southwards into the EU, detec-
tions decreased significantly. No signif-
icant migratory incidents took place in 
the Black Sea.
The overall demographics of migrants 
in 2019 show an increase in the share 
of vulnerable groups, including a slight 
growth in the share of women and chil-
dren. Europol has received particularly 
worrying reports about the kidnapping 
of vulnerable irregular migrants, includ-
ing unaccompanied minors, once they 
arrive in the EU.
Member States reported an increase 
in the detection of clandestine entries 
on both land and sea routes, the latter 
showing a stronger relative growth. As 
regards land borders, most clandestine 
entry attempts in 2019 were again in

the Western Balkans region. According 
to the demograph ics of the migrants in-
volved, those who are detected attempt-
ing to enter clandestinely (a risky modus 
operandi) are 97% male. Organised crime 
groups continue to focus on specific na-
tionalities, as evidenced by the fact that 
65% of all detected cases of clandestine 
entry attempts concern a single nation-
ality (Afghan).
Secondary movements remained siz-
able in 2019 judging by, for instance, the 
rising number of detections of illegal stay 
and by the fact that applications for inter-
national protection collected by EASO also 
increased. Further evidence of the rise in 
secondary movements in 2019 is that the 
number of discoveries of such movements 
inside the EU/Schengen area increased in 
2019 for the third year in a row. The re-
ported figures grew by almost 38% com-
pared with 2018 and reached the highest 
level since Frontex started collecting data 
on this indicator. In addition, high num-
bers of people smugglers continue to be 
detected inland. Secondary movements 
by sea also grew in 2019.
Beyond migration, the results of Fron-
tex joint operations and EU joint action 
days as well as Member States’ data for 
2019 shed some light on the sizable ex-
tent of cross-border crime. Smuggling 
of firearms, drugs, stolen vehicles and 
other illicit goods, as well as people smug-
gling and trafficking in human beings 
is happening every day on the EU’s ex-
ternal border. The complex character of 
cross-border crime threats necessitates 
a comprehensive operational response 
at the borders.
As in previous years, the number of ef-
fective returns in 2019 fell short of the re-
turn decisions issued by Member States. 
Around 139 000 migrants who were not 
granted refugee status or subsidiary pro-
tection were returned to their countries 
of origin, less than half (approximately 
47%) the total number of return deci-
sions issued in the same period. While 
the number of return decisions increased 
by around 5%, effective returns dropped 
6% (both compared to 2018) to the low-
est level since data has been collected 
on this indicator. This finding of course 
does not take into account the fact that 
many Third Country nationals receive 
multiple return decisions, and in many 
cases voluntary returns are not properly 
documented or reported. Southern Asian 
and Western Balkan citizens saw signif-
icant decreases (both in relative and ab-
solute terms) in the number of effective 
returns, whereas there were considerably 
more returns to South America.

3. Introduction
The Frontex Risk Analysis for 2020 re-
ports on all aspects relevant for Euro-
pean Integrated Border Management. For 
this reason, developments and threats to 
the security of the EU’s external border 
and the Schengen area are analyzed. The 
aim is to limit the challenges and threats 
for border management by risk analy-
sis and to ensure the functioning of the 
Schengen area.
Frontex’s operational activities aim at 
strengthening border security by support-
ing Member States in their implementa-
tion of EU measures for the management 
of external borders.
The coordination of operational activ-
ities contributes to a more efficient al-
location of Member States’ resources as 
well as the better protection of freedom, 
security and justice. In this context, this 
Risk Analysis concentrates on the scope 
of Frontex’s operational activities and, in 
particular, on irregular migration at the 
external borders of the EU and Schengen 
Associated Countries.
Regulation (EU) 2016/1624 significantly 
enhanced Frontex’s mandate to ensure the 
efficient implementation of European In-
tegrated Border Management as a shared 
responsibility of the Union, the Agency 
and national authorities of the Member 
States. More recently, Regulation (EU) 
2019/1896 further reinforced the Agency’s 
mandate and increased its competences.
European Integrated Border Man-
agement consists of 12 strategic compo-
nents defined in Article 3 of the Agency’s 
Regulation: 
 <U+25AA> Border control, including measures to 
detect and prevent cross-border crime 
at the external borders; 
 <U+25AA> Search and rescue operations; 
 <U+25AA> Analysis of risks for internal security; 
 <U+25AA> Information exchange and coopera-
tion with and between Member States; 
 <U+25AA> Inter-agency cooperation; 
 <U+25AA> Cooperation among relevant Union in-
stitutions, bodies, offices and agencies; 
 <U+25AA> Cooperation with third countries; 
 <U+25AA> Border control measures within the 
Schengen area; 
 <U+25AA> Return of third-country nationals; 
 <U+25AA> Use of state-of-the-art technology; 
 <U+25AA> Quality control mechanisms; 
 <U+25AA> Solidarity mechanisms. 
These components, together with the 
three horizontal components – funda-
mental rights, education and training, re-
search and innovation – collectively form 
also the basis for of the technical and 
operational strategy for European Inte-
grated Border Management. The strategic 
and horizontal components are conse-
quently applied onto the four-tier-access 
control model, which comprises meas-
ures in third countries, such as under 
the common visa policy, measures with 
neighbouring third countries, border con-
trol measures at the external borders, risk 
analysis and measures within the Schen-
gen area and return.
In order to cover all aspects of Inte-
grated Border Management, this annual 
report has been structured as follows: 
(1) the situational picture for the Euro-
pean Border and Coast Guard as regards 
irregular migration in accordance with 
the concept of Integrated Border Man-
agement; followed by (2) a description 
of other border management challenges 
impacting the workload of border guards 
caused by passenger flows, pandemics, 
terrorism and various forms of cross-bor-
der crime, (3) featured analyses on key 
risks affecting the security of the exter-
nal borders and/or internal security; and 
finally (4) outlook for the year.
The Agency and in particular its Risk 
Analysis Unit would like to express its 
gratitude to all members of FRAN in 
Member States and third country part-
ners for their efforts in providing data 
and information, as well as EASO and 
Europol, and all colleagues involved in 
the preparation of this report.

4. Methodology
A coherent and comprehensive analy-
sis of the risks affecting security at the 
external borders requires, above all, the 
adoption of common indicators. Consist-
ent monitoring of these indicators al-
lows effective measures to be taken on 
the ground. The analysis needs to iden-
tify the risks that arise at the external 
borders themselves and those that arise 
in third countries.
This Risk Analysis for 2020 is based upon 
the monthly statistics exchanged among 
Member States within the framework of 
the FRAN. For this, the key indicators col-
lected through the FRAN were:
 <U+25AA> detections of illegal border-crossings 
at green and blue borders and at BCPs;
 <U+25AA> refusals of entry;
 <U+25AA> detections of illegal stay;
 <U+25AA> detections of facilitators;
 <U+25AA> detections of fraudulent documents;
 <U+25AA> return decisions;
 <U+25AA> effective returns and passenger flow 
data (when available).
Concerning applications for interna-
tional protection, in order to avoid dou-
ble reporting, Frontex stopped collecting 
asylum data from MSs in July 2019 and 
since then only works with data collected 
by EASO.
The data were categorised by border 
type (land, air or sea), and those on land 
borders were additionally grouped by 
border section with neighbouring third 
countries. The data exchanged within 
the FRAN are compiled and analysed on 
a quarterly basis. Priority is given to the 
use of the data for management purposes 
and to rapidly sharing data among Mem-
ber State border-control authorities.
Member States’ data processed by 
Frontex are not treated as official statis-
tics and thus may occasionally vary from 
those officially published by national au-
thorities. Throughout 2019, some FRAN 
members made backdated changes to 
their 2018 statistics. These changes have 
been incorporated into this document, 
hence some data presented here may dif-
fer from those presented a year ago in the 
Risk Analysis for 2019.
Member States were not requested 
to answer specific questions in support 
of this analysis. Rather, bimonthly ana-
lytical reports and incident reports from 
Member States routinely collected within 
the FRAN, as well as other Member States’ 
contributions submitted in 2019, were 
12 of 70
Frontex · Risk Analysis for 2020
used, especially as regards the analysis of 
routes and modi operandi. Intelligence de-
rived from debriefing activities carried 
out within Joint Operations was also es-
sential analytical material.
Open-source information was also ex-
ploited, especially in identifying the main 
‘push and pull factors’ for irregular mi-
gration to the EU. These sources included 
reports issued by government agencies, 
international and non-governmental or-
ganisations, as well as mainstream news 
agencies and EU bodies.
External borders, a term often used in 
this report, refer to the borders between 
Member States and third countries. The 
borders between the Schengen Associated 
Countries (Norway, Iceland, and Switzer-
land) and third countries are also consid-
ered as external borders. By contrast, the 
borders between the Schengen Associated 
Countries and Schengen Member States 
are considered as internal borders. Sta-
tistics on detections of facilitators and 
illegal stay and asylum are also reported 
at the land borders between Schengen 
Member States and Member States that 
have either not yet joined the Schengen 
area in full (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, 
Romania) or have opted to stay out of it 
(the UK – a MS throughout 2019 – and 
Ireland). Thus, total figures for Member 
States and Schengen Associated Coun-
tries as a whole can be presented.
It was not possible to make the dis-
tinction for air and sea borders because 
Member States do not habitually differ-
entiate between extra-EU and intra-EU 
air and sea connections, but tend to ag-
gregate data for all arrivals per airport/
seaport. Consistent with other law-en-
forcement indicators, variations in ad-
ministrative data related to border control 
depend on several factors. In this case, the 
number of detections of illegal border-
crossings and refusals of entry are both 
functions of the amount of effort spent, 
respectively, on detecting migrants and 
the actual flow of irregular migrants to 
the EU. For example, increased detec-
tions of illegal border-crossing might be 
due to a real increase in the flow of ir-
regular migrants, or may be due to more 
resources made available to detect them. 
In exceptional cases, increased resources 
may lead to a rise in reported detections 
while effectively masking an actual de-
crease in the migratory flow, resulting 
from the deterrent effect of those in-
creased resources.

tions and a framework of security, sta-
bility and freedom. As the individuals’ 
decisions to migrate are often rational 
choices made with incomplete infor-
mation (for those who do in fact have 
a choice), the perception of costs and ben-
efits are weighed. How these perceptions 
are formed is an intricate process, and the 
information gained from, for example, 
personal networks and select media dif-
fers widely between individuals.
While there have been information 
campaigns to dissuade economic mi-
grants, they are limited in scope. How-
ever, potential migrants are continuously 
exposed to media which show them how 
desirable a future in Europe may be. State 
actors also set the parameters of migra-
tion by influencing conditions in the 
countries of origin – among them eco-
nomic opportunities, individual liberties 
and religious freedoms. 
The legal framework for migration is 
another important factor migrants have 
to consider when intending to leave a 
country of origin and to enter an EU 
Member State or Schengen-Associated 
Country. Once the decision to migrate has 
been taken, however, border management 
in both the country of origin and po-
tentially in transit countries comes into 
play, shaping the concrete opportunities 
to migrate and crucially the costs with 
their efforts to control migration (inevi-
tably leaving loopholes), counter irregu-
lar migratory movements or fight people 
smuggling networks. The capacity of bor-
der management is of importance for the 
migration process, impacting the means 
of irregular movements.
Judging from the number of mi-
grants who made asylum applications, 
attempted illegal border-crossings, stayed 
in the EU illegally or were refused en-
try in 2019, the European Union con-
tinues to be a desirable destination for 
migrants. More than 180 nationalities

Name of indicator
were recorded under the above indicators 
in 2019, clearly indicating the global ex-
tent of migratory pressure towards the EU 
(see the above map). On the other hand 
a glance at the map also highlights the 
importance of partnerships with key non-
EU countries.
Migratory movements towards the 
EU regularly occur, far removed from the 
well-publicised rubber dinghies in the 
Mediterranean. Firstly, more than 700 
million legal travellers enter and leave 
the EU every year. Demand for short-
term visas remains very strong; for ex-
ample, just over 16 million applications 
for short-stay visas were lodged at the 
consulates of Schengen States in 2018.
Secondly, migration based on family 
reunification continues to be important. 
According to an EMN Focused Study from 
2016, family reunification was the rea-
son behind more than 30% of new arriv-
als in 21 Member States, even exceeding 
50% in some Member States (BEL, GRC, 
ESP, HRV, LUX and SVN).
Moreover, several studies1 and Frontex 
empirical data (based on debriefing in-
terviews) clearly suggest that one of the 
biggest drivers of migration towards the 
EU is the presence of a diaspora in the 
1 For example “International Migration 
Drivers. A quantitative assessment of the 
structural factors shaping migration” 
JRC, 2018 
destination Member States. This is true for 
both regular and irregular immigration.
Thirdly, the existence of a smuggling 
infrastructure in key transit regions (e.g. 
transport, lodging, fraudulent documents 
etc.) and access to irregular legalisation 
options once in the EU (e.g. misuse of asy-
lum provisions, identity fraud) contribute 
to the appeal of migration towards the EU.
Lastly, the EU is located relatively close 
to several crisis areas in the Middle East 
and North Africa, where large pools of po-
tential / would-be migrants are located (e.g. 
Libya, Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan). Like-
wise, the lack of economic opportunities 
in the countries of origin (Africa, Asia and 
Latin America), and demographic pres-
sures drive movements towards the EU.

Key neighbouring and transit 
regions
In the context of the external dimen-
sion of European integrated border man-
agement (EIBM), cooperating with the 
key transit countries is a very effective 
tool. In the past and currently, migration 
flows were addressed in multi- or bilat-
eral agreements, including prominent 
cooperation agreements such as the one 
between Spain and Morocco, the EU-Tur-
key Statement and – as happened during 
the 2015/16 migration crisis – agreements 
between several EU Member States and 
Western Balkan countries. While some 
agreements may be regarded as more sus-
tainable than others, their results support 
the conclusion that multi- or bilateral 
agreements can alleviate migratory 
pressure on select border sections with 
almost immediate effect.
Frontex data suggest that there 
are roughly a dozen non-EU countries 
through which the vast majority of ir-
regular migrants pass before being de-
tected at the external borders of the EU. 
Working closely with these countries is 
therefore a key element of the European 
integrated border management strategy.

Sum of detections of cases of

The Agency’s assessment also suggests 
that any perceived or actual deficiency 
of border and migration management 
systems and their components in these 
transit regions can result in much higher 
pressure towards the EU.
On the other hand, effective collab-
oration that merely prevents migrants 
from entering the EU may well in the 
short term mean a rise in the numbers 
of migrants in neighbouring third coun-
tries, as few migrants are initially dis-
suaded from their goal of reaching the 
EU. In the longer run, however, if these 
efforts are sustained, migrant numbers 
may dwindle as migrants make use of re-
turn schemes and fewer people leave their 
countries of origin as the word gets round 
of reduced chances of success. Truly sus-
tainable collaboration, however, goes far 
beyond just the symptoms, and involves 
also fighting the organised crime net-
works that enable migrant flows, build-
ing border management capacity and 
facilitating information exchange. Be-
yond the realm of border guarding, also 
cooperating in the development of coun-
tries of origin is necessary to tackle the 
root causes of migration.

The Western Balkans and Turkey
Turkey will remain the key country 
along the Eastern Mediterranean route. 
As of 2019, Turkey’s Ministry of Interior 
estimated around 4.9 million migrants 
to be present in Turkey. Over 3.6 million 
of them are Syrians. Between 1 January 
and 30 November 2019, Turkey report-
edly prevented roughly 84 000 seaborne, 
and over 41 000 land-borne departures of 
migrants towards the EU. A rising trend 
was observed, especially from July on-
wards. Border surveillance in the Aegean 
from both the Greek and Turkish side is 
crucial to detect vessels in distress and 
to avoid non-intercepted arrivals on the 
Greek islands. The size, composition and 
location of migration flows across Turkey 
and on the Eastern Mediterranean are de-
termined by multiple factors, including:
 <U+25AA> border and migration enforcement 
measures taken by Turkish Security 
Services within Turkey;
 <U+25AA> the situation in Syria;
 <U+25AA> instability in Afghanistan;
 <U+25AA> the economic situation in the Middle 
East and South Asia;
 <U+25AA> changes in migrant workers’ access 
to Saudi Arabia or changes in mi-
grants’ perceptions related to the ac-
cessibility of the Western Balkans. 
Migration in the Western Balkan re-
gion will continue to be influenced, to 
a large extent, by the size of the flows 
along the Eastern Mediterranean route.1 
If readmissions under the EU-Turkey 
statement remain low, this will lead to a 
further overcrowding of the reception fa-
cilities on the Aegean islands2, prompting 
1 Over 50 000 migrants reached Greece by 
sea, and 8 000 by land (cut-off date: 30 
November), while Turkey prevented over 
100 000 departures in the same period.
2 Over 39 000 migrants on the islands 
as of 3 December 2019, surpassing the 
reception capacity by a factor of three. 
subsequent transfers to the mainland3 
with knock-on effects in the Western 
Balkans.
Migrants already in the region, to-
gether with those expected to arrive from 
the south, will continue to exert pressure 
on the borders of Croatia, Hungary and 
Romania. It is likely that they will apply 
the “mass movement” modus operandi 
to force their way across regional borders.
Finally, the availability of and con-
ditions in reception centres, the prom-
ise of more favourable living conditions 
elsewhere, and access to smuggling ser-
vices will determine most intra-regional 
movements as well as pressure on the re-
gion’s northern borders.4
3 Over 32 000 up to 30 November 2019.

shelter, they abscond, try to cross borders, 
and if they fail they return.

North Africa, the Maghreb and 
West Africa
The stability of Libya and the Libyan 
Coast Guard’s operations in its assigned 
SAR area will continue to be key deter-
miners of flows across the Central Medi-
terranean. Likewise, the presence of naval 
assets, including NGO vessels, in the prox-
imity of Libya’s territorial waters and 
their access to EU ports will also play 
a vital role.
North Africa is also likely to gener-
ate a new stock of migrants that will be 
willing to travel to the EU using all avail-
able means. This will be largely driven 
by the poor economic prospects for the 
entire region. Several countries in the 
region need to re-examine their devel-
opment model and speed up necessary 
structural reforms.
Morocco, Senegal and Mauritania will 
remain key partners for the EU and its 
Member States in these regions. In fact, 
they all have already demonstrated their 
willingness to jointly tackle the issue of 
irregular migratory flows that mostly af-
fect Spain (the Canary Islands, Ceuta and 
Melilla and the Strait of Gibraltar).
Morocco detected more than 27 000 
irregular migrants and dismantled more 
than 60 smuggling networks in 2019. The 
General Directorate for National Secu-
rity (DGSN) also reported the discovery of 
roughly 3 000 fraudulent travel or iden-
tity documents.
The Eastern European 
neighbouring region
Smuggling of excise goods and illicit 
drugs as well as trafficking in leased/
rental vehicles will remain the most sig-
nificant threats to border security on the 
EU’s eastern land borders.
The smuggling of illicit drugs (mainly 
hashish from the EU and heroin to the 
EU)5 on the EU’s eastern external bor-
ders is likely to continue increasing in 
the foreseeable future as smugglers de-
velop more sophisticated modi operandi.
Ukraine is likely to be increasingly 
attractive as a transit country for na-
tionalities that enjoy visa-free travel to 
Ukraine (e.g. Turkish nationals). Further-
more, the visa-free policy for Turkish citi-
zens in Ukraine is likely to generate more 
demand for fraudulent Turkish docu-
ments from the various migrant com-
munities in Turkey or its neighbourhood 
(e.g. Iranians).

Data reported by Member States indi-
cate a total of 141 846 detections of illegal 
border-crossing along the EU’s external 
borders in 2019, which represents a 4.9% 
decrease compared with the number of 
detections recorded in 2018 (and a 92% 
decrease compared with the 1.8 million 
detections at the height of the migra-
tion crisis in 2015). Looking a little fur-
ther into historical data, the number of 
illegal border-crossings in 2019 fell to its 
lowest level since 2013. A decrease in mi-
grant numbers of less than 5% compared 
with 2018 signifies that the rate of the de-
crease slowed down significantly in 2019.
Even though arrival figures decreased 
in 2019 for the fourth year in a row, it is 
instructive to go back further in the data 
collection: for instance, the number of 
detections in 2019 is roughly compara-
ble to the figure for 2011, when strong 
migratory pressure was exerted on the 
EU’s south-eastern land borders and also 
in the Central Mediterranean.
The 2019 decrease occurred primarily 
due to fewer detections on the Western 
and Central Mediterranean routes, a re-
sult primarily of determined prevention 
efforts by Northern African countries. On 
the other hand 2019 saw continuously 
mounting migratory pressure on the East-
ern Mediterranean route and the corre-
sponding pressure in the Western Balkans.
Irregular migration to Europe in 2019 
did not deviate from well-known patterns 
along the established routes. More than 
two-thirds of all illegal border-crossing 
detections at the EU’s external borders in 
2019 were again made at sea in the Medi-
terranean, along familiar migration corri-
dors. The three main routes - crossing the 
Western, Central and Eastern Mediterra-
nean - are indicated above, along with 
the relative flows from the main coun-
tries of origin. According to the collective 
findings from EU and MS  law enforce-
ment authorities involved, migrants on 
the Mediterranean routes are primarily 
smuggled on rubber boats, toy boats, or 
small fishing boats, with very basic life-
saving and rescue equipment. 
It has become more common for boats 
to reach the EU without the presence of 
a smuggler. The vast majority of migrant 
smugglers run their illegal business from 
the last country of departure to the EU, 
with connections in source, transit and 
destination countries.
The number of detections of illegal 
border-crossing in 2019 indicates a slight 
growth in the share of women and child 
migrants compared with 2018.
In 2019, in line with the intense migra-
tory pressure on the Eastern Mediterra-
nean route and related to the heightened 
pressure on the Western Balkan route, mi-
grants from the Middle East and South-
ern Asia represented a larger share of all 
detected illegal border-crossings. In fact, 
these two regions accounted for over half 
(around 87 500 arrivals or 62%) of all regis-
tered irregular arrivals in the EU in 2019. 
Of this subset, the respective main coun-
tries of origin, Afghanistan and Syria, ac-
counted for roughly 41% of the registered 
illegal border-crossings.
The largest decrease in absolute num-
bers of irregular arrivals (a decrease of 
almost 31 000 compared with 2018) was 
from Africa, specifically from western 
and northern Africa, although in the for-
mer case the exact magnitude is unclear 
due to the categorisation of many mi-
grants from West Africa as ‘unspecified 
sub-Saharan nationals’. The total number 
of African migrants who used the East-
ern Mediterranean route increased how-
ever, in contrast to the steep decreases on 
both the Western and Central Mediter-
ranean routes.

The Eastern Mediterranean route saw 
the highest total in detected illegal bor-
der-crossings since 2016. Compared with 
2018, almost 27 000 more migrants on 
this route were reported by Greece, Cy-
prus and Bulgaria. Geographically, the 
migratory pressure in 2019 focused on 
the Eastern Aegean Sea and on Cyprus.
The pressure on the Greek and Bulgar-
ian land borders with Turkey markedly 
eased in 2019. In fact, reported detections 
there fell by almost half compared with 
2018. Turkish migrants in 2019 made 
up an even larger share of these arrivals 
than in 2018.
In the Eastern Aegean on the other 
hand, migratory pressure rose in the 
spring and peaked in September, when 
arrivals started falling chiefly due to 
weather conditions. In the second half 
of the year, arrivals were the highest 
since the implementation of the EU-
Turkey Statement despite the Turkish 
Coast Guard’s continued resolve to pre-
vent irregular migrant departures. Mi-
grant smugglers satisfied the increased 
demand, in particular from Afghan and 
Syrian migrants, by adapting their modi 
operandi and using simultaneous depar-
tures. Push factors throughout many key 
countries of origin and long-term host 
countries throughout Southern Asia and 
the Middle East intensified as the year 
progressed and materialised in migra-
tory pressure on the Eastern Mediterra-
nean route. Around half of all migrants 
on this route were rescued in search and 
rescue operations.
Cyprus in 2019 experienced a further 
increase in migrant arrivals, in fact since 
2013 reported detections by Cyprus have 
been continuously increasing, although 
exponentially since 2016. Compared to 
2017, the number almost tripled in 2019. 
More pertinently, EASO reports that Cy-
prus was by far the leading country in 
terms of asylum applications relative to 
population size (150 applications per 10 
000 inhabitants). It ranked second in 
terms of applications relative to the coun-
try’s geographic size.
On the Eastern Mediterranean route 
in 2019 the increase in Afghans stood 
out, with their numbers increasing by 
167% (in absolute numbers an increase of 
roughly 18 000 migrants). Of this demo-
graphic, the share of women increased, 
with their numbers almost tripling: 
Over 11 000 Afghan women arrived, of-
ten with their families. Many of these 
Afghan families arriving in Greece had 
departed from Afghanistan or Iran. But 
apart from Asia, some African countries 
also had significantly more migrants ar-
rive on the Eastern Mediterranean route, 
in particular from Congo (Kinshasa), So-
malia, Cameroon and Congo (Brazzaville). 
From all of these countries significantly 
more women arrived (from Cameroon 
only slightly). Over 2 600 unaccompa-
nied minors were reported to Frontex on 
this route in 2019.

The Western Balkan migration route also 
saw increased migratory activity in 2019 
compared with 2018, in particular due to 
the increased number of illegal border-
crossings towards the end of the year, 
many of them purportedly repeated at-
tempts by the same migrants. In fact, al-
most half of all detections on this route 
were recorded in the last quarter of the 
year. In the latter part of the year pres-
sure focused on the EU’s borders with 
Serbia. Throughout the year, the land 
borders to this region recorded slightly 
fewer refusals of entry.
The Western Balkan route continues to 
be mostly transited by irregular migrants 
trying to reach Western Europe from Tur-
key. This continues to be a testing route 
avoided by families, as the large share of 
young male migrants suggests. 94% of all 
migrants detected at the EU’s borders on 
entry from the region in 2019 were male. 
Both corridors through the region saw 
activity throughout the year, the cen-
tral route via Serbia and the route from 
the Greek-Albanian border. The western 
corridor into Albania reported mount-
ing detections after the start of Frontex’s 
joint operation in May. Migratory pres-
sure was projected northward from each 
of the corridors, along the Bosnian and 
Herzegovinian–Croatian–Slovenian cor-
ridor and on Serbia’s border with Hun-
gary, Croatia and Romania. Slovenia felt 
much of the pressure emanating from 
the region throughout 2019.
According to Europol, most migrant 
smuggling cases in 2019 concerned the 
Western Balkan region. The most com-
mon modus operandi here was clandestine 
entry using often life-threatening means 
of concealment in various types of ve-
hicles. Migrant smugglers often used 
different kinds of vehicles to transport 
irregular migrants in the region, in par-
ticular cars, (mini-) vans, and trucks. Con-
cealment methods ranged from simply 
hiding irregular migrants in the cargo 
space of a van or boot of a car to con-
structing furniture around irregular mi-
grants and sophisticated custom-built 
compartments. Frontex data indeed show 
that the majority of reported clandes-
tine entries at the EU’s external borders 
took place in this region, almost exclu-
sively by male migrants aged 18 to 34. The 
number of migrant smugglers detected 
at the borders to this region reported 
to Frontex fell, most likely suggesting 
the increased sophistication of people 
smuggling networks rather than a de-
crease in smuggling activities. For those 
migrants who cannot afford the smug-
glers the sharing and use of offline maps 
with detailed information on the routes 
is a commonly used modus operandi. Those 
who reach their final destinations share 
maps of their journey with other mi-
grants. These maps show the safest places 
to cross the border as well as good hid-
ing places. In 2019 tunnels were found 
at the southern EU border to the region.
The top nationalities detected trans-
iting the region were largely similar to 
those reported on the Eastern Mediterra-
nean route. A third of all migrant detec-
tions concerned Afghan citizens, closely 
followed by Syrians. Iraqis, Iranians. Turk-
ish nationals complete the list of the five 
most common nationalities using this 
route.
On the circular route from Albania 
southwards, detections decreased signifi-
cantly, by 57% compared with 2018 to their 
lowest level since FRAN data collection 
commenced in 2009. It is believed that 
these cross-border movements continue 
to reflect seasonal labour migration. 96% 
of all cases are attributed to Albanians, 
supporting this assessment.

The Central Mediterranean in 2019 re-
corded its lowest yearly number of ir-
regular migrants since before the Arab 
Spring. A 40% decrease in migrants com-
pared with 2018 denotes the third year 
in a row of reduced arrivals in this re-
gion. Irregular migratory activity was 
very low at the beginning of 2019, but 
it then picked up in the summer and in 
particular in the autumn.
As regards departures from Libya, 
which in 2019 was the country of last 
departure for well over half of the mi-
grants who reached the EU on this route, 
prevention activities by the Libyan Coast 
Guard kept departures down through-
out the year, and thus also arrivals in 
the EU. The conflict in Libya, which in-
tensified as the year progressed, did not 
appear to affect the coast guard’s activ-
ities. Including arrivals and prevented 
departures as well as those rescued by 
the Libyan Coast Guard, an estimated 
17 000 migrants attempted to reach the 
EU by sea in 2019. Of the main nation-
alities departing from Libya, Eritreans – 
in 2018 the most common nationality 
on this route – saw the largest relative 
and absolute decrease. Sudanese, Bang-
ladeshi and Ivorian migrants were more 
numerous than Eritreans on this corri-
dor in 2019. Almost 1 500 unaccompa-
nied minors were registered amongst 
those who had departed from Libya, al-
most four times as many as those who 
were accompanied by family members.
All other migratory corridors in the 
Central Mediterranean (i.e. departures 
from Algeria, Tunisia and Turkey) also 
reported decreased activities compared 
to 2018. Tunisia was the main country of 
departure for migrants detected on the 
Central Mediterranean route in February, 
April and September. Almost 600 unac-
companied minors were reported on this 
corridor, which represents the majority 
of all registered minors (around 750). As 
the year progressed, the share of non-Tu-
nisian migrants departing from Tunisia 
increased. In 2018 a mere 9% were non-
Tunisian, whereas in 2019 their share 
increased to 28%, led by Ivorians. In fact, 
Ivorians accounted for more than half of 
all the non-Tunisian nationals on this 
route. Departures from the east of Algeria 
on the other hand continued to be made 
up almost entirely of Algerian nationals.
A modus operandi that continued 
throughout 2019 was the use of sailing 
boats travelling from Turkey to Italy, 
either directly or via Greece. The aver-
age number of migrants per vessel in 
2019 was 55 from Turkey to Italy, while 
via Greece the average was 24 migrants 
per vessel. Frontex estimates that second-
ary movements by sea from Greece to It-
aly generate particularly high profits per 
smuggled migrant for people smuggling 
groups. Pakistani, Iraqi and Iranian mi-
grants made up the vast majority of all 
migrants who used this relatively expen-
sive option (there are instances where 
migrants have purportedly paid up to 
EUR 10 000 for the journey) to reach 
the EU from Turkey. In 2019, 300 unac-
companied minors were reported aboard 
leisure boats arriving in Italy from Tur-
key, which represents an increase com-
pared to 2018.

On the Western Mediterranean route, 
a 57% decrease in arrivals compared to 
the peak year of 2018 was reported. While 
in 2018 an increase in migrants from 
different Asian countries, mostly from 
Bangladesh, was recorded, 2019 saw their 
share drop (from 1.3% in 2018 to 0.8% in 
2019). While the number of Moroccans 
decreased in line with the overall flow in 
comparison with 2018, Algerian migrants 
increased their share as their number 
only fell slightly, a decrease solely due 
to slightly fewer departures from Mo-
rocco (the number that departed from 
their country of origin remained virtu-
ally unchanged).
After January 2019, departures from 
Morocco on the Western Mediterra-
nean sea route decreased significantly 
(by 57% for the entire year compared 
with 2018). After very quiet months in 
the spring, in the summer and autumn 
the numbers recovered somewhat. Ac-
cording to Europol, in 2019 there was 
an increase in cases involving jet skis 
and speedboats, traditionally used for 
drug trafficking, for people smuggling 
on this corridor.
At the land borders significantly fewer 
(-71%) incidents were reported in 2019, al-
most exclusively involving sub-Saharan 
migrants. Clandestine entry attempts at 
border-crossings points also fell to less 
than half the number in 2018. Refusals 
of entry at the land borders fell as well.
Migration pressure on the Algerian 
corridor pertaining to the Western Med-
iterranean route rose in the autumn, as 
in previous years. Overall the number of 
detections remained similar to the pre-
vious two years. 
According to Europol, in this region 
it has become more common for boats 
to reach the EU without the presence of 
a smuggler on board. In some cases, peo-
ple smugglers escort the boat loaded with 
irregular migrants only for the first part 
of the sea crossing, leaving irregular mi-
grants on their own to sail towards the 
EU. OCGs active on the Western Medi-
terranean route are particularly known 
for their poly-criminality, often being in-
volved in other criminal activities, such 
as trafficking in human beings and drug 
trafficking. A newly discovered modus 
operandi in 2019 was the facilitation of 
irregular migration in semitrailers, which 
are loaded onto ferries connecting Tang-
ier (Morocco) with Barcelona (Spain) and 
Savona (Italy).
The Western African route in 2019 re-
corded roughly twice the number of de-
tections compared with 2018 making it 
– with approximately 2 700 migrants – 
the busiest year for this route in a decade. 
While departures from Senegal only in-
creased slightly, departures from Morocco 
more than doubled. This increase was 
made up of sub-Saharan migrants, while 
the number of Moroccan migrants en 
route to the Canary Islands only slightly 
increased.

On the Eastern borders route, the num-
ber of illegal border-crossings decreased 
with figures falling to their lowest level 
since the inception of FRAN data col-
lection. The 722 reported illegal border-
crossings signify a drop by approximately 
one-third compared with 2018. Vietnam-
ese migrants, the foremost migrant group 
detected over the past few years at the 
Eastern borders, dropped to a mere 62 
migrant arrivals in 2019, a drop of 83% 
compared with 2018. Successes in dis-
mantling organised crime groups – often 
specialising in smuggling select nation-
alities – are likely behind the drop in de-
tections. Clandestine entry attempts at 
border-crossing points were once again 
not a major occurrence, with a mere 13 
cases for the entire year.
Due to the decrease in Vietnamese 
arrivals at the Eastern borders, Turkish 
migrants became the most common na-
tionality detected for illegal border-cross-
ing. Two neighbouring countries have 
over the last two years adopted visa-free 
agreements with Turkey. Some Turkish 
nationals have used this new opportu-
nity of visa-free traveling and abused it. 
Most likely the resulting trend to transit 
via the two countries in question would 
have been more accentuated, but there 
was also a significant rise in the num-
ber of refusals of entry issued to Turk-
ish nationals by these two countries. This 
shows that many more were barred from 
transiting there.
In general, refusals of entry at the 
Eastern borders increased even further 
in 2019: Almost 114 000 refusals were is-
sued at the Eastern land borders, 21% (or in 
absolute terms almost 20 000) more than 
in 2018. Of the main reasons associated 
with the significant number of refusals 
issued, the only reason that saw a de-
crease was no sufficient means of subsist-
ence in relation to the period and form of 
stay or the means to return to the coun-
try of origin or transit. More than half of 
these refusals (and 45% of all refusals at 
all land borders) were issued to Ukraini-
ans, mostly because they were not able to 
provide justification for their stay. With 
over 11 000 additional cases, Ukraini-
ans were behind much of the aforemen-
tioned increase. Russians received almost 
9 000 additional refusals vis-à-vis 2018, 
being responsible for an additional ma-
jor share of the overall increase. With ap-
proximately 7 500 refusals, Belarusians 
were the third-most common refused 
nationality at the Eastern land borders. 
For Russians and Belarusians the most 
reported reason for refusal was that the 
concerned individual was not in posses-
sion of a valid visa.
Detections of illegal stay on exit also 
increased slightly at the Eastern borders 
to approximately 28 500 cases. Ukraini-
ans, who stayed beyond the permitted 
period, were responsible for the vast ma-
jority of cases.

5.2. Fraudulent Documents
External borders
In 2019, over 7 000 fraudulent document 
users were detected at the EU’s exter-
nal borders (entry/exit/transit), 5% fewer 
than in 2018.
Of this total number, some 5 700 de-
tections were made on entry to the EU/
Schengen area from third countries, 
which is a 13% decrease in comparison 
with 2018. The most significant decrease 
was reported by Poland and Hungary and 
the 40% decrease reported by Spain at the 
external EU borders. The latter related to 
migrants from Morocco, while the former 
related mostly to Ukrainian nationals ar-
riving on fraudulent travel documents 
from Ukraine.
The most significant increase involves 
Turks, Albanians, and nationals of Kos-
ovo1. Of these nationalities, Kosovars re-
1 This designation is without prejudice to 
positions on status, and is in line with 
UNSCR 1244 and the ICJ Opinion on the 
Kosovo declaration of independence.
corded the most marked intensification 
compared with 2018. As in 2018, the po-
litical situation in Turkey continues to be 
the main ‘push factor’ for the increasing 
number of Turkish citizens successfully 
reaching EU countries.
At EU level, of the 133 nationalities de-
tected using fraudulent documents to il-
legally enter the EU/SACs from a third 
country, the most commonly recognised 
were unchanged compared with 2018. 
Nonetheless, the number of detected 
Ukrainian, Iraqi and Russian fraudulent 
document users decreased dramatically 
in 2019.
As in previous years, most detec-
tions of fraudulent documents were re-
ported on air routes. Indeed, seven out 
of ten detections affect this border type. 
The number of document fraud cases 
from Morocco’s Casablanca airport in-
creased by 114% in 2019 compared with 
2018. Consequently, Casablanca airport 
became the top departure airport for de-
tections of fraudulent documents from 
third countries.
The Italian airports were the most af-
fected by this increase in detections in-
bound from Casablanca. A large majority 
of detected fraudulent document users 
identified in Italy arriving from Casa-
blanca are from sub-Saharan countries, 
e.g. Ghana, Mali, Nigeria, the Democratic 
Republic of Congo, Senegal and Guinea.
The second most reported last depar-
ture airport in 2019 was the new inter-
national “Yeni Havalimani” airport in 
Istanbul.
An increase in detection of fraud-
ulent documents was also noticed on 
flights arriving from Brazil, Tunisia and 
the Emirates.
Many cases related to migrants trans-
iting the EU from one third country to 
another were reported from European 
Union and Schengen Associated Coun-
tries airports, where especially African 
nationals in transit were pretending to 
travel to different destinations outside 
Europe. Instead they applied for asylum 
at the transit airport.

Nationality of users of fraudulent documents detected 
by MS - absolute number in 2019 and relative to 2018.
As in 2018, in 2019 the border between 
Hungary and Serbia bore the brunt of doc-
ument fraud cases, mainly involving na-
tionals from the Western Balkan region. 
The number of Kosovar fraudulent doc-
ument users doubled compared to the 
previous year.
At the land borders, the most evi-
dent increase was in the use of fraud-
ulent Turkish, Serbian and Romanian 
documents.
There was a dramatic decrease in the 
number of reported detections at var-
ious Eastern land borders with Russia 
and Belarus.
At the external sea borders, no signif-
icant change was observed in compari-
son with previous years regarding entries 
from third countries.
Intra EU/Schengen movements
In contrast with the fall in detections 
of fraudulent documents on entry from 
third countries, on secondary movements 
inside the EU/Schengen area, the number 
of detections increased in 2019 for the 
third year in a row. The reported figures 
increased by almost 33% compared with 
2018 and reached their highest level ever.
The unceasing increase in demand 
from within the EU for fraudulent doc-
uments has prompted established coun-
terfeiters to find new supply channels. 
There is now the opportunity to buy coun-
terfeit or stolen travel and other identi-
fication documents on the web and the 
dark web. The documents offered on the 
internet are frequently stolen by organ-
ised gangs.
A dramatic increase in the number of 
attempts to reach Ireland using fraudu-
lent documents was registered in 2019.
The number of detections on journeys 
to Ireland has more than doubled, mak-
ing it the most popular route for irregu-
lar migrants using fraudulent documents.
Several Greek airports saw a noticea-
ble increase in the number of attempts to 
travel within the EU/Schengen area us-
ing fraudulent documents. Many Italian 
airports also described similar increases.
In the context of the general develop-
ment, Italian documents continue to be 
the favourites used by fraudulent docu-
ment users on secondary movements. Al-
banians, who registered another dramatic 
increase in the number of detections, pre-
fer to use these documents when trav-
elling illegally to Ireland or the United 
Kingdom.
At sea borders, the most noticeable 
increase in fraudulent document detec-
tion was on the main routes from Greece 
with a registered increase in the num-
ber of Turkish, Syrian and Afghan na-
tionals detected.

5.3.  An integrated asylum-migration picture by EASO, Europol 
and Frontex
The Schengen area is one of the most 
important achievements of the Euro-
pean Union. The abolition of internal bor-
ders allows EU citizens and many non-EU 
nationals, tourists and professionals to 
move freely among 26 countries with-
out being subject to passport or border 
controls. Yet, while providing countless 
benefits to genuine travellers, freedom 
of movement also facilitates less legit-
imate movements and the activities of 
ill-intentioned people who are able to en-
ter the Schengen Area. This means that 
strengthening the EU’s external borders 
and the effective implementation of the 
Common European Asylum System are 
essential elements in delivering internal 
security to European citizens and ensur-
ing that those within the free-movement 
area can fully enjoy its benefits.
2015 and 2016 were exceptional for 
the European Union and the Schengen 
Associated Countries (EU/SACs). During 
this period an unprecedented number 
of third-country nationals crossed the 
EU’s external (land and sea) borders ei-
ther in need of protection or searching 
for better opportunities within the EU/
SAC area. The number of arrivals have 
since decreased, but the situation at the 
external borders and within the Schen-
gen area remains dynamic.
While illegal-border crossings (IBCs) 
of the external land and sea borders 
have declined over the past years, grad-
ually reaching pre-migration crisis levels 
- the approximately 142 000 IBCs regis-
tered in 2019 were the lowest in five years 
and 5% fewer than in 2018 - the number 
of those detected staying illegally on the 
territory of EU/SACs has remained high. 
For example, in 2019, there were more 
than 400 000 detections of illegal stay-
ers (10% more than in 2018) largely due to 
increased detections of nationals of Mo-
rocco (by 49%), Moldova (47%), Eritrea (38%), 
Algeria (31%) and Afghanistan (11%). While 
detections were widely distributed across 
all countries, they largely took place in 
Central and Western European countries.
In contrast to fewer detections of IBCs, 
applications for international protec-
tion actually increased compared to a year 
ago. In 2019, some 715 000 applications for 
international protection (13% more than in 
2018) were lodged by third-country nation-
als in the EU/SAC area. This means that 
there were five times as many applica-
tions for asylum as there were detections 
at the external border, a complex discrep-
ancy with many underpinning factors.
An important aspect is related to 
third-country nationals who apply for 
asylum more than once within the same 
EU/SAC after having received a negative 
decision on a previous application. Spe-
cifically, in 2019, 9% of all asylum applica-
tions at EU/SAC level were repeated. These 
proportions were the highest among na-
tionals of Serbia (34% of all Serbian appli-
cations), Russia (22%), Moldova (20%), as 
well as from Sri Lanka, Nigeria and Sen-
egal (more than 15% each). On the other 
hand, countries in Central and South 
America such as Venezuela, Colombia, 
El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and 
Peru had the lowest share of repeated ap-
plications, which implies that they may 
have been new arrivals in the EU.
Equally relevant is the fact that many 
third-country nationals, who apply for 
asylum, previously crossed the external 
border in a regular fashion. Currently, 
62 states and territories worldwide en-
joy a visa-free regime to the EU/SAC area, 
many of which represent important 
places of origin for applicants of interna-
tional protection. Last year, slightly more 
than a quarter of all asylum applications 
were submitted by nationals from visa-
exempt countries. Applications lodged 
by Venezuelans and Salvadorans doubled 
from 2018, those by Colombians tripled, 
and the trend was similar for other Latin-
American countries. Despite on a smaller 
scale, applications by Georgians also in-
creased, continuing an upward trend for 
a fourth successive year. Although most 
visa-free nationals enter legally, some 
overstay their permission to stay and then 
become irregular, a phenomenon that ap-
peared to be particularly common among 
nationals from Ukraine, Russia, Moldova, 
Serbia and North Macedonia.
Asylum applications are also lodged by 
applicants who may have crossed the ex-
ternal land and sea borders undetected 
and then continue their journey inside 
the EU/SAC area towards their country of 
destination. Migrants and asylum seek-
ers travelling through irregular migra-
tion routes sometimes attempt to evade 
registration on arrival as the countries of 
entry represent transit points. This situa-
tion is well illustrated in cases of migrant 
smuggling reported to Europol. According 
to Europol, last year most of these cases 
concerned the Western Balkans region, 
where migrant smugglers and organised 
crime groups (OCGs) used various types of 
vehicles such as (mini-)vans and trucks 
to transport irregular migrants across 
the region. Concealment methods were 
a common modus operandi and ranged from 
hiding people in the cargo area of a van or 
the trunk of a car to more sophisticated 
custom-built compartments.
The activities of the European Bor-
der and Coast Guard Agency at the ex-
ternal borders have been very important 
in reducing opportunities for undetected 
crossings of the external borders. Offic-
ers deployed to the Agency’s operations 
help to register, screen and fingerprint 
incoming migrants and asylum seekers, 
as well as identify and refer, in coopera-
tion with EASO, those in need of interna-
tional protection, while simultaneously 
supporting EU/SACs to detect and prevent 
migrant smuggling, human trafficking 
and other forms of cross-border crime, 
sharing relevant intelligence with na-
tional authorities and Europol. The man-
agement of mixed migration flows and 
the fight against cross-border crime have 
been further enhanced by the implemen-
tation of a Joint Operation in Albania (at 
the land border with Greece) – the first 
ever Frontex operation in a Third Country.
While illegal border-crossings include 
only arrivals by land and sea, some third-
country nationals also travel to the EU/
SAC area by air. In order to enhance the 
chances to reach their preferred destina-
tions, some use fraudulent documents 
(e.g. counterfeit visas, passports, and resi-
dence permits, authentic but fraudulently 
obtained visas, authentic documents used 
as impostors). Last year, reported cases of 
arrivals by air with the use of fraudulent 
documents involved a number of nation-
als of Morocco, Turkey, Iran, Ukraine and 
30 of 70
Frontex · Risk Analysis for 2020
Albania. Some of them might have applied 
for asylum sometime after arrival, but the 
number of applications lodged at air bor-
der-crossing points in EU/SACs has re-
mained low, at about 2% of all applications 
in 2019. In line with intelligence available 
at Europol, last summer there was a re-
emergence of smuggling of third-coun-
try nationals by plane from airports in 
the first countries of arrival towards air-
ports in northern EU/SACs facilitated by 
the use of forged or look-alike documents.
Even though a large number of third-
country nationals apply for asylum upon 
arrival, not all of them remain present 
for long enough to complete the proce-
dure. Sometimes asylum applications 
are withdrawn implicitly, potentially 
because of absconding in order to reapply 
in a different EU/SAC at a later stage. In 
2019 one application was implicitly with-
drawn for every fifteen that were lodged. 
This phenomenon was particularly rel-
evant for nationals of Morocco and Al-
geria, for whom the ratio of lodged to 
implicitly withdrawn applications was 
five to one. Among the citizens applying 
in high numbers in 2019, the ratios were 
also relatively high for nationals of Tur-
key, Pakistan and Afghanistan.
For those seeking international protec-
tion on the territory of the EU/SACs, the 
lodging of an asylum application is only 
the beginning. After submission, appli-
cations must be examined by national 
asylum authorities (with varying timings 
across EU/SACs and countries of origin) 
who are responsible for issuing a decision 
at first instance. In 2019, only one third 
of first-instance decisions culminated 
with the granting of refugee status 
and subsidiary protection. Unsuccess-
ful applicants – or those unhappy with 
the outcome (e.g. because they were only 
granted subsidiary protection) have the 
possibility to submit an appeal – a step 
that prolongs the asylum process to a fi-
nal decision. Once a negative decision 
becomes final, the next step in the pro-
cess is a return decision, following which 
the failed asylum seekers are returned to 
their country of origin. Last year, approx-
imately 11 000 third-country nationals 
were returned by EU/SACs after receiv-
ing return decisions.
However, not all third-country nation-
als who arrive in the EU/SACs irregularly 
have the intention to apply for interna-
tional protection or travel for the pur-
poses of seeking asylum. Some decide 
to remain illegally (e.g. because they 
may not have legal grounds for protec-
tion). This is particularly true for nation-
als from North African countries such 
as Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. For ex-
ample, last year Algerian and Moroccan 
nationals each submitted over 10 000 
asylum applications, but the number of 
those detected staying illegally within 
the territory of EU/SACs – approximately 
21 500 Algerians and 33 000 Moroccans 
- far outweighed requests for interna-
tional protection. Some of them could 
be failed asylum applicants as the high 
ratio of implicitly withdrawn to lodged 
applications suggests. The situation was 
similar for Tunisians, whose more than 
4 000 applications for international pro-
tection were far below the 8 259 illegal 
stay detections.
On the other hand, others are brought 
to EU/SACs and transported across the 
free movement area for purposes other 
than irregular migration. In 2019 Eu-
ropol supported an operation targeting 
a poly-criminal network involved in mi-
grant smuggling, trafficking in human 
beings and drug trafficking. The OCG tar-
geted minors in protection centres in one 
EU/SAC and transported them to another 
EU/SAC by buses used to smuggle hash-
ish, tobacco and hunting species.
The past year remained challenging 
for national asylum, reception, border 
guard and law enforcement authorities 
in the EU/SACs. In this context, EASO, 
Europol and Frontex continued to invest 
efforts in supporting their stakeholders 
according to needs. Furthermore, despite 
differences in their mandates, EASO, Eu-
ropol and Frontex remain committed to 
cooperation in different aspects of their 
work, including analysis that contributes 
to a better understanding of the asylum 
and migration picture in the EU/SACs.

5.4.  Returns
Member States reported just under 
300 000 return decisions issued to third 
country nationals in 2019 (298 190). The 
figure was around 5% higher than what 
was reported in 2018 and was the second 
highest reported number for this indica-
tor since 2011, when the FRAN data col-
lection on this indicator began. However, 
the absolute number of return decisions 
actually issued might vary. For instance, 
data for this indicator in 2019 was una-
vailable for three Member States. Varia-
tions in numbers are also largely reliant 
on what data Member States exactly re-
port, which mainly depends on the prac-
tices in place in each Member State when 
issuing return decisions. For example, in 
some federal EU countries, several dif-
ferent authorities are in charge of issu-
ing return decisions, but not all of them 
might be reporting this data to FRAN. In 
addition, according to the national legis-
lation in some Member States, an irreg-
ular migrant might also receive several 
return decisions that are reported, accu-
mulating to a sizable share of this indi-
cator. It can therefore be asserted that, 
when taking into account the aforemen-
tioned caveats, no direct comparison or 
link between the indicators of return de-
cisions and effective returns should be 
established.
In line with available data from pre-
vious years, the number of return deci-
sions issued in 2019 was far larger than 
the number of effective returns report-
edly carried out in the same year. Member 
States registered around 138 860 effective 
returns to third countries in 2019, a fig-
ure that is around 6% lower than in 2018. 
Also, it is the lowest reported total for this 
indicator since 2011. The decrease in the 
number of effective returns can be linked 
to many factors, stemming from lower ir-
regular migratory pressure towards the 
EU in 2019, to the fact that many return-
ees leave the EU voluntarily without there 
being evidence that they have actually left 
the territory of the EU Member State/SAC, 
hence no reporting of these occur. Some of 
the obstacles that Member States may face 
during the return process include prac-
tical problems such as the identification 
of migrants and obtaining the necessary 
documents from the authorities of third 
countries, as well as many migrants who 
abscond from the return process. Frontex 
has developed many tools to assist Mem-
ber States in returns (see 7.1).
Bearing in mind the many challenges 
that arise from both the return process 
and its reporting, available data for 2019 
show that the main recipients of return 
decisions were, in line with 2018, na-
tionals of Ukraine, Morocco and Afghan-
istan. While the share of Ukrainians who 
were issued a return decision decreased 
slightly between 2018 and 2019, the num-
ber of return decisions to Moroccans in-
creased by 23%. When looking at the ten 
most reported nationalities for return de-
cisions in 2019, nationals of Albania, Pa-
kistan, Syria, Algeria, Brazil and Turkey 
also witnessed an increase for this indi-
cator, while the number of Iraqis showed 
a decrease in comparison with the pre-
vious year. The vast majority of return 
decisions were reportedly issued by EU 
countries of arrival. The three countries 
issuing the most return decisions were, 
respectively, Greece, Spain and Poland.

That the number of effective returns may sometimes be higher than return decisions, as a return decision issued in a given month may be effectively enforced at a later date. Also, return decisions may be issued without 
prejudice to the person’s right to apply for asylum. Readmissions between Member States are not included (for example between France and Italy). Effective returns do not necessarily mean returns to the country of origin and, 
for example in the case of Syrians, they include returns of persons to third countries considered to be safe (for example from Hungary to Serbia).
In line with previous years, Ukraini-
ans, Albanians and Moroccans were the 
most reported nationalities for effective 
returns in 2019. All three showed a de-
crease when comparing data with the 
year before, despite actually presenting 
an upward trend for detections of illegal 
stay between 2018 and 2019. On the other 
hand, the share of Georgian returnees in-
creased in 2019 in comparison with the 
previous year, while the number of Al-
gerian and Russian returnees remained 
relatively stable. The number of Geor-
gians being returned witnessed a stark 
increase of 46% when comparing 2019 
with 2018, with an increasingly higher 
trend since 2017, when the visa obligation 
was waived. The data is also in line with 
a general increase in the migratory pres-
sure of this nationality towards the EU, 
with more and more detections of illegal 
stay being reported by Member States.
Conversely, effective returns of Syrians 
and Afghans decreased by 38% and 36% re-
spectively in 2019 compared with 2018, 
despite the number of detections of ille-
gal border-crossings of these nationali-
ties having risen last year. One possible 
reason for these varying trends is that 
arrivals started to increase in the second 
half of the year, which means in the vast 
majority of cases the asylum procedure 
is still ongoing. Effective returns of Syr-
ians and Afghans are expected to remain 
at low levels, because of high asylum rec-
ognition rates and the limited possibility 
to return. In fact, according to Eurostat 
data1, the asylum recognition rates calcu-
lated between 2016 and 2019 for nation-
als of Syria is 95%, while for Afghans it is 
50%, thus the vast majority of returns of 
these nationalities do not materialise2, 
in line with inter alia the principle of 
non-refoulement.
Since 2016, Member States have 
started to report gradually increasing 
numbers of effective returns of South 
American citizens. Comparing data of 
2019 with 2018, the increases are espe-
cially visible for Peruvian and Colombian 
returnees, 80% and 41% respectively. The 
upward trend is in line with the gen-
eral increase in the migratory pressure

return decisions can be issued before the 
asylum procedure starts.
towards the EU as well as relatively low 
asylum recognition rates.
Overall in 2019, around 71 100 returns 
were reportedly carried out with the sup-
port of Member States and/or Frontex, 
and these mainly involved nationals of 
Albania, Morocco and Algeria. Voluntary 
departures3 reported in 2019 amounted to 
around 67 600, 36% of which were Ukrain-
ians, followed by around 3 800 Georgians 
and just over 3 000 Albanians opting for 
this method of return. Furthermore, in-
creasingly higher numbers of returnees 
benefited from administrative and finan-
cial support. In fact, assisted voluntary re-
turns provide tailored support, including 
reintegration, to those individuals who 
would like to travel back to their coun-
try of origin in a dignified manner. Lastly, 
the number of returns that happened in 
the framework of bilateral readmission 
agreements rose from around 4 800 in 
2018 to more than 6 300 in 2019.

Passenger Flow on Entry to Subset of EU/SAC Illegal Stay on Exit for EU/SAC

6.1.  Passenger Flow and Border Guards’ Workload
Passenger flow data is an important in-
dicator of border guards’ workload. 2019 
was another demanding year for border 
guards in Member States. They were faced 
with a further rise in passenger flows and 
the corresponding increase in entry and 
exit checks at border-crossing points. In 
2017 systematic checks were expanded 
to cover passengers enjoying the right of 
free movement under EU law. This has at 
times led to delays for passengers at cer-
tain border-crossing points and continues 
to put a greater burden on border guards.
As in previous years, in 2019 the re-
corded passenger flow peaked in August. 
While passenger flow data are difficult to 
compare from year to year, some Mem-
ber State data suggest that passenger 
flow at air, land and sea borders slightly 
increased compared with 2018. In fu-
ture years, the forthcoming Entry-Exit 
System (EES) and its automatically gen-
erated passenger flow data will provide 
a comprehensive picture and offer further 
opportunities for risk analysis.
The second line at border-crossing 
points was also kept busy in Member 
States by, for instance, an increase in re-
fusals of entry along external borders, as 
well as an increase in document fraud de-
tections. Detections of illegal stay on exit 
at air, land and sea borders remained at 
a very high level, increasing slightly com-
pared with 2018, albeit a decrease in de-
tections at the air borders vis-à-vis 2018 
was compensated by an increase at the 
land borders, in particular at the East-
ern land borders.
Air Borders
In 2019 across all main indicators there 
was an increase in irregular migration at 
the external EU air borders.
It is believed that many migrants who 
are currently in the EU irregularly arrived 
by air  having gained entry by deception 
or overstaying and not leaving as obliged.
At the EU/SAC air borders there was 
a  year-on-year increase in passenger 
flows. It is estimated that the increase 
is about 5% per annum across Europe.
There were significant increases in the 
number of Brazilians, Albanians, Peruvi-
ans and Georgians refused entry in 2019.
The most affected airports were: Ma-
drid (MAD) (5 172) with mainly nationals 
of Latin American countries, Paris (CDG) 
varied, and Lisbon (LIS) mainly Brazilians.
Following Schengen visa liberalisa-
tion for Georgia, there have been large 
increases in the refusal of entry of this 
nationality at air borders. Budget airlines 
particularly have responded to the new 
travel opportunities provided by visa lib-
eralisation by increasing flights from/to 
Georgia, linking to larger and smaller re-
gional EU/SAC airports.
37 of 70
Frontex · Risk Analysis for 2020
There has also been both an increase 
in the level of asylum applications and 
refusals of entry of migrants from South 
and Latin American countries. In respect 
of Venezuelans, over 5 000 claimed asy-
lum at air borders, however over 40 000 
claimed asylum in-country after entry.
Frontex operations at third country 
airports located quite close to EU exter-
nal borders indicated that migrants are 
also seeking to use local visa waivers and 
then to enter the EU by obtaining fraud-
ulent travel documents and crossing land 
borders. In this respect there has been an 
increase in refusals of Indian and Chinese 
nationals arriving at Belgrade (BEG) who 
are visa free in Serbia1.
Iranian and Turkish nationals have 
been identified seeking to transit the EU/
SAC via Tbilisi (TBS) and Baku (GYD) – 
mainly Iranians – and Kiev (KBP) – mainly 
Turkish – using fraudulent documenta-
tion often of high quality.
1 http://www.mfa.gov.rs/en/
consular-affairs/entry-serbia/visa-regime
Nationals of some countries requiring 
a Schengen visa have been identified as 
abusing the transit visa waiver at larger 
airports associated with hubs operated 
by global airlines, e.g. Amsterdam, (AMS), 
Frankfurt (FRA), Paris (CDG) and Madrid 
(MAD). They arrived from a non-EU/SAC 
and whilst claiming to be in direct air-
side transit to another non-EU country 
they claimed asylum.
This has shown to be an increasingly 
popular way to gain entry to the EU/SAC 
which invariably does not require the ser-
vices of a human smuggler or the use of 
forged, counterfeit or inappositely ob-
tained documentation.
In respect of document abuse, 70% of 
all document abuse detected at the air 
borders is on intra EU/Schengen flights 
as opposed to those arriving at the ex-
ternal borders.
The year 2019 also saw a large increase 
in migrants seeking to exit EU/SAC air-
ports to travel to the UK and Ireland us-
ing fraudulent documentation. Indeed 
for most EU/SAC airports their biggest 
migratory threat is dealing with pas-
sengers with such documents seeking 
to travel to the UK or Ireland. In 2019 
some 3 000 such migrants arrived in the 
UK and an almost equal number were 
stopped seeking to board flights to the 
UK. A further 1 390 were detected seeking 
to travel to Ireland. Intelligence suggests 
that human smugglers were proposing to 
migrants that they should seek to enter 
the UK and Ireland prior to Brexit.

6.2. Pandemics and border control
The reoccurrence of infectious diseases, 
epidemics or pandemics have always pre-
sented border guard authorities with 
many challenges. SARS, Ebola and bird 
flu (avian flu) have in the 2000s already 
been some of the health scares, but none 
has had more impact than the emergence 
of the ‘coronavirus disease’ (COVID-19), 
which by mid-March 2020 had report-
edly surpassed 180 000 confirmed cases 
and 7 000 deaths globally1.
Border guard authorities, alongside 
other competent authorities, have, of 
course, already collected some experience 
from the aforementioned diseases, for 
instance from the response to the 2002-
2004 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
(SARS), also a coronavirus. There is how-
ever a crucial difference, which makes the 
current COVID-19 pandemic an unprec-
edented challenge: SARS patients were 
only infectious after the onset of symp-
toms. This appears to be different in the 
case of the novel coronavirus. Patients 
suffering from COVID-19 are infectious 
before the onset of symptoms. Asymp-
tomatic travellers are therefore not eas-
ily identified at points of entry and may 
spread the disease2. This means that pro-
cedures such as checking temperature 
are only in part effective in stopping the 
spread. Consequently, following this logic, 
measures such as quarantining all trav-
ellers and/or altogether closing the bor-
ders have been introduced.
What has ensued within the European 
Union goes well beyond the reintroduc-
tion of border controls within the Schen-
gen area. Rather it constitutes a closing 
down of the borders to whole groups of 
travellers, in some cases even Union citi-
zens. Still, travel restrictions may delay the 
dissemination of the coronavirus but they 
cannot prevent it once it has already been 
introduced into the population. Yet such 
a delay is reasoned to be in line with the 
strategy of ‘flattening the epidemic curve’ 
(i.e. slowing down the spread of the disease 
to avoid a peak of the pandemic). The sci-
entific consensus is that the suppression 
strategy is the best approach for saving 
lives – the uppermost goal - regardless of 
the great economic costs and social disrup-
tion. Otherwise, healthcare systems and 
intensive care units might collapse as in-
fections soar and mortality rates rise sig-
nificantly. Once strict control measures 
are relaxed, however, the transmission of 
coronavirus disease might once again re-
bound.3 Particular care and a cautious ap-
proach is therefore of utmost importance.
Given the special characteristics of 
the COVID-19 pandemic – in particular 
its comparatively long incubation period 
combined with the infectiousness of carri-
ers before showing symptoms – the chal-
lenges to border guards across Europe are, 
of course, widely different from previous 
responses to diseases. While on the one 
hand global travel is plummeting and 
reducing the burden of entry and exit 
checks, these checks may have to expand 
in scope (i.e. including health aspects). 
Also, the closing of internal borders is 
binding border guard personnel, which 
some border authorities have long stopped 
planning for. And finally, the spread of the 
infection to staff and quarantine measures 
may further stretch the capacity of bor-
der guard authorities to deploy personnel.
The role of Frontex in supporting Mem-
ber States is manifold. First of all, the 
health crisis elevates the need for a com-
mon situational picture. On a daily basis, 
Frontex is providing up-to-date mon-
itoring of the crisis to Member States 
and the Agency looks to contribute to 
an integrated approach to effective bor-
der management to protect health while 
preserving the integrity of the internal 
market. Amongst many other actions, 
the Agency also contributed to the guide-
lines on the handling of border control ac-
tivities in the time of heightened health 
risks. And finally, committed to the duty 
of care for all its staff and deployed per-
sonnel, the Agency is taking all steps to 
outfit its joint operations and Headquarter 
staff with the necessary protective gear.

6.3. Cross-border crime: Firearms
It is estimated that 60 percent of the 640 
million firearms currently in circulation 
worldwide are in civilian hands1. Flows of 
illicit firearms fuel armed conflicts and 
violent criminal organisations. Illegal 
firearms may be used for coercion and 
intimidation in other crime areas. The 
recent terrorist attacks in the EU and ac-
companying seizures of firearms during 
cross-border and inland operations dem-
onstrate the multidimensional nature of 
illicit firearms trafficking. Once in circu-
lation, illegal firearms can pose a risk for 
decades. Given all these issues, illicit traf-
ficking of firearms is constantly consid-
ered a high threat.2
Around 80% of the illicit firearms 
transported within the EU are destined 
to stay in the EU3. A significant amount of 
the firearms used in the EU are imported. 
Also easily convertible weapons manufac-
tured in the EU tend to be modified and 
used for lethal purposes. These are also 
very often transported outside the EU. The 
routes used depend on the current situa-
tion, legal requirements and firearms leg-
islation in particular countries. Two main 
corridors have been identified, one from 
the Western Balkans to Northern Europe 
and the other from the Eastern land bor-
ders towards the United Kingdom.
The European Border and Coast Guard 
Agency is tasked with addressing seri-
ous crimes that adversely affect the se-
curity of the EU’s external borders, for 
instance smuggling of drugs and fire-
arms. In 2019 border authorities seized 
numerous weapons, mostly during bor-
der checks at the external border. Most 
of these were cold arms, prohibited pep-
per sprays and electric shockers, but fire-
arms and ammunition were also found.

2 SOCTA 2017 is a comprehensive study 
of serious and organised crime in the 
EU released by EUROPOL. It is the 
outcome of a detailed analysis of the 
threat of serious and organised crime 
facing the EU providing information for 
practitioners, decision-makers and the 
wider public.
3 Estimations made by the European Crime 
Prevention Network.
The majority of these seizures were not 
the result of large-scale weapons traffick-
ing. Numerous actors were involved, from 
individuals smuggling for their own use 
to organised criminal groups distribut-
ing firearms in large quantities.
Various sources suggest that crisis 
regions and former crisis regions, like 
Ukraine or the former Yugoslavia, are 
a huge source of illegal weapons. However, 
this has not been confirmed by detections 
at the borders. Incidents of smuggling of 
ammunition and gas pistols or converted 
firearms towards these regions have also 
been reported, which might indicate that 
weapons with a lower penalty in case of 
detection are in demand.
Information exchange with countries 
neighbouring the EU in the Western Bal-
kans and Eastern Europe indicate that 
the border control authorities in those 
regions continue to detect weapons, am-
munition and explosives, but with a de-
creasing long-term trend.
According to the findings from Joint 
Action Days (for instance Joint Action 
Day Mobile 2 across Europe), detections 
of firearms and ammunition are more 
likely when intense search measures are 
employed. In general, targeted searches of 
vehicles increase incidental seizures (by-
catch). This implies that the amount of 
firearms smuggling is significant.
Due to the growing presence of il-
licit firearms in the EU, it is important 
to underline the significance of coopera-
tion with all EU and international bodies 
as well as with Border Guard and Cus-
toms authorities to achieve an appropri-
ate, comprehensive and tailored response 
to detecting transportations at the bor-
ders through detailed checks of travel-
lers based on profiling.

During Joint Action Day Mobile 2, sniffer dogs located hiding places in a

6.4. Cross-border crime: Drug Trafficking
Drug trafficking is a highly lucrative 
criminal activity which generates large 
profits for organised criminal structures 
worldwide. With the great majority of 
drugs used in Europe passing through the 
EU’s external borders, the European Bor-
der and Coast Guard Agency has a major 
role to play in tackling drug smuggling.
In 2019 there were 658 cases and 130.6 
tonnes of various drugs detected during 
Frontex-coordinated operational activities, 
an increase of 50% in the number of detec-
tions but a slight reduction in the quan-
tity of seizures.4 The majority of seizures 
occurred in the maritime domain with 
52% of the cases and 98% of the quantities. 
Being equally important, detections in 
the Balkans and on the Eastern land bor-
ders were typically related to the traffick-
ing of small quantities of various narcotic 
substances and pharmaceuticals through 
BCPs. These small quantities were usually 
found in passenger cars, buses and lorries.
Furthermore, cooperation with Mem-
ber State authorities resulted in the seizure 
of an even larger quantity, 356 tonnes, of 
drugs during surveillance activities at the 
4 JORA, Results of Frontex Joint Operations
EU’s external borders.5 While large seizures 
were again related to maritime borders, 
a variety of drugs was also seized on land 
routes and at EU airports. The trafficking 
of drugs by air presents serious challenges 
to authorities with constantly increas-
ing passenger flows at the international 
airports. Passengers arriving from South 
American countries, as well as from Af-
rica, smuggling drugs by body-packing, in 
clothes or in hold baggage are the typical 
types of cases at airports. Similar smug-
gling methods have become popular on sea 
and land routes as well, usually on ferry 
connections between ports in the West-
ern Mediterranean and Adriatic. Notably, 
postal packages for receiving or redistrib-
uting drugs in Europe have been increas-
ingly used over the past few years.
Trafficking through interchanging 
routes and using various means of trans-
port have become a common modus operandi 
for concealing the cargo’s place of origin. 
Traffickers employ this modus operandi in an 
5 EUROSUR, Detections reported during 
surveillance activities at EU external 
borders
effort to reduce and deflect the attention 
of law-enforcement authorities.
Generally, the top smuggled drug at 
the EU’s external borders is cannabis 
both in number of cases (68%) and quan-
tity (97%).6 Easy production, high availabil-
ity and accessibility, cultural and regional 
characteristics, as well as lower penalty 
risk in some countries contribute to the 
popularity of herbal cannabis and hash-
ish. Cannabis is the most widely con-
sumed illicit drug in Europe with a large 
proportion of the herbal cannabis grown 
closer to the place of consumption. Out-
door cultivation sites and numerous in-
land seizures reported in EUROSUR by 
Member States during border surveillance 
activities confirm the Western Balkans 
and Albania in particular as a source of 
herbal cannabis trafficked to neighbour-
ing countries via land routes or exported 
to Western and Central Europe via the 
Adriatic Sea, using speedboats or ferries.
The proximity of Morocco, which has 
been considered the leading producer 
of cannabis resin for years facilitates 
the trafficking of hashish mostly in the

Western Mediterranean, but also on most 
sea routes in southern Europe, predom-
inantly by speedboats. Hashish traffick-
ing is accompanied by other criminal 
activities, including facilitated irregular 
migration and property crime, as crimi-
nals generally use existing criminal in-
frastructure for distribution of hashish to 
Western and Northern European markets 
and to countries in Asia and North Africa.
Cocaine accounts for almost one third 
of the EU retail drug market, which makes 
it the second most commonly consumed 
illicit drug in the EU after cannabis. This is 
reflected in the second highest rate of sei-
zures in Europe after the Americas. The re-
cord number of seizures over the last two 
years at European ports in the North Atlan-
tic, the North Sea and the West Mediterra-
nean point to the Western European coast 
as the main entry gate of cocaine to Europe.7
The enormous supply from Latin Amer-
ica and the drop in wholesale prices world-
wide in the last couple of years have made 
cocaine more affordable than ever before, 
and this has resulted in frequent bulk ship-
ments on various maritime routes, but 
also in smaller quantities at land borders 
and airports. In 2019 seizures of almost 12 
tonnes of cocaine were reported, mostly 
by Portugal and Spain, the most affected 
locations being the Azores, Lisbon, Setu-
bal, Valencia port, Barcelona port, Algeciras 
port, and the Canary Islands. Portuguese, 
Spanish and Italian airports also registered 
a large share of detections on incoming or 
transiting flights from Latin America and 
South and West Africa.8 Maritime shipping 
containers as well as other types of mar-
itime transportation will be increasingly

surveillance activities at EU external 
borders
used for importing cocaine either via di-
rect transatlantic routes from Latin Amer-
ica to Western Europe or via transhipment 
hubs in West Africa and the Caribbean.
In the recent years, North Africa has also 
emerged as a significant transit area for co-
caine destined for Europe. Morocco and to 
a lesser extent Algeria and Libya are consid-
ered entry hubs recently reporting large co-
caine hauls.9 Seizures of smaller quantities 
of cocaine on the southern Spanish coast 
and at Spanish ports (e.g. Algeciras, Valen-
cia, Barcelona, etc.) suggest an increase in 
the supply of cocaine in the region.
The smuggling of heroin into Europe 
is usually characterised by fewer detec-
tions on specific drug routes. This is due 
to the concentration of production in Af-
ghanistan, which to a certain extent lim-
its supply and distribution markets. In 
2019 approximately 472 kg of heroin were 
reported. The largest quantities were de-
tected during numerous seizures at French, 
Italian and Spanish airports, but also dur-
ing several big hauls at French and Italian 
seaports. These seizures tend to show that 
along with typical land routes, maritime 
and air transports are also used to smuggle 
heroin to destination countries in Europe.10
Sporadic large hauls of heroin and to 
a lesser extent cocaine in some Member 
States and third countries suggest that 
typical routes are highly diversified fol-
lowing not only the most used Balkan 
route, but also passing through different 
regions in Central Asia. The Caucasus her-
oin route and partly the Northern route 
are also used, where third countries at the 
Eastern and South-eastern land borders

10 EUROSUR, Detections reported during

could be convenient distribution hubs for 
both the EU and Russian markets.
Synthetic drugs and precursors con-
tinue to be a threat to the EU’s external 
borders, appearing in small quantities on 
air routes, but recently more often in large 
consignments from China on sea routes. 
Notably, there has been an increase in the 
detection of captagon arriving in ports in 
the Eastern Mediterranean, as well as sei-
zures of ecstasy on yachts in the Aegean 
Sea. A large container seizure of ecstasy 
precursor in 2018 supports the findings 
for increased precursor trafficking in the 
Aegean and Mediterranean ports.
The precursor market is also influenced 
by shifting a part of the heroin production 
to drug laboratories in Europe, which leads 
to demand for illicit sourcing of acetic anhy-
dride. Similar developments have been ob-
served in the cocaine production process.11

6.5. Cross-border crime: Stolen Vehicles and Parts
Despite the decreasing trend in Europe 
over the last several years, car thefts con-
tinue to have a serious financial impact 
on society, with an average of 697 000 
car thefts per year in the EU.12 Moreover, 
around 3.5 million alerts for searched ve-
hicles are registered in the SIS II database 
each year, and around 15 500 hits are gen-
erated.13 Persons engaged in motor vehi-
cle crime are motivated by the prospects 
of fast profit. These people perceive the 
risk of detection and prosecution as low.
In 2019 there were 384  vehicles 
searched and 578 vehicle parts stopped 
at border-crossing points during Fron-
tex-coordinated operational activities, 
which shows similar detection rates com-
pared to previous years.14 The majority 
of the targeted vehicles were common 
car makes and models, with crimi-
nals trading in large quantities on the 
12 Eurostat, crime statistics 2015-2017
13 EU-LISA, SIS II 2018 Statistics
14 JORA, Results of Frontex Joint Operations
second-hand vehicle and parts market. 
Of those detections supported by Frontex, 
78% involved passenger cars (in different 
price categories), followed by a signifi-
cantly lower share of lorries and trail-
ers (9%), and vans. Nevertheless, special 
attention should be given to incidents 
involving stolen lorries and heavy ma-
chinery, considering the difficulties in 
identifying and recovering those types 
of vehicles, as well as the higher finan-
cial impact of those crimes.
Furthermore, taking an active role 
in European Multidisciplinary Platform 
Against Criminal Threats (EMPACT) op-
erational activities, the Agency supported 
the efforts of the Member States in pre-
venting the traffic of 475 stolen vehicles 
and 394 parts.15 The increased effective-
ness of short-term tailored actions reveals 
the potential risk at the EU’s external bor-
ders and the challenges in detecting and 
searching vehicles during regular border 
15 EMPACT, results of EU joint action days 
control activities. Criminals use various 
methods in order to go unnoticed such 
as using the cover of the regular flow of 
travellers and goods via the commonly 
used border-crossing points.
The main reasons for detection were 
alerts in SIS or Interpol databases (57%), 
alterations of the vehicle’s identifica-
tion number (36%), false or exchanged 
licence plates (4%) or registration docu-
ments (3%). Some of the cases included 
insurance fraud or vehicles stolen from 
rental or leasing companies. It is worth 
mentioning the increasingly close rela-
tionship between vehicle theft and doc-
ument fraud, identified as a result of the 
European joint action days (JADs). In ad-
dition, different characteristics of the car 
market in neighbouring third countries 
also influences the market for falsifying 
car registration documents and manip-
ulating the vehicle identification num-
ber (VIN).

The vehicles were usually driven by 
one driver via land BCPs, being driven as 
a means of transport and not as a com-
modity. Drivers of various nationalities 
were involved in transporting stolen vehi-
cles across the borders. Their nationality 
usually matched the country they were 
attempting to cross into. In some cases 
cars were transported inside trailers, or 
dismantled in parts inside cargo vans. 
The illicit market of stolen or substand-
ard spare parts is a lucrative source of in-
come for criminal organisations, which, 
besides the financial impact, puts driv-
ers in general at serious risk.
The common modus operandi involved 
the immediate transportation of the sto-
len vehicle outside of the EU towards end-
destinations in the Middle East and Asia 
or dismantling it into parts. Yet almost 
one-third of the vehicles were detected 
on entry, which is a strong indication 
that Europe is also a big market for sto-
len vehicles.
The Eastern land borders represented 
57% of all detections, with vehicles cross-
ing the borders with Ukraine having the 
highest share (36%). Serbia’s borders in the 
Western Balkans scored second highest 
with 25% of cases. A number of cases at 
the borders with Belarus and the Rus-
sian Federation in the northeast, as well 
as with Turkey indicate the continuous 
use of routes for the export of stolen ve-
hicles through Eastern Europe to Cen-
tral Asia and through the Balkans to the 
Near and Middle East.
In addition, maritime transport is 
also considered by criminals for mov-
ing stolen vehicles to countries in other 
continents. Export routes identified by 
Member State law-enforcement author-
ities are via the ports of Rotterdam and 
Hamburg towards countries in Africa.16 
There were several reports in the last two 
16 Interpol, Motor Vehicle Crime in Global 
Perspective 2014; Bundeskriminalamt, 
KFZ-Kriminalität, Bundeslagebild 2012
years in the framework of border surveil-
lance activities, referring to similar mo-
dus operandi of exporting luxury SUVs to 
Mauritania via Dakar and Senegal. Fer-
ries in Italy, Greece and Spain connect-
ing land routes in Europe and between 
Europe and North Africa were also used 
for transporting stolen vehicles.17
It is expected that criminals will con-
tinue using BCPs on the main transport 
corridors for moving different types of 
vehicles, depending on demand. Pre-
venting vehicle crime at the borders re-
quires strong cooperation between border 
guards and other law enforcement au-
thorities for better pre-warning and tar-
geted intelligence-led actions.

6.6. Managing and Interdicting Terrorist Mobility
A global and omnipresent threat
Terrorism is not exclusive to Islamist 
extremists. This said, when it comes 
to counter-terrorism efforts within the 
border dimension, it is assessed that 
the main threat emanates from Islam-
ist extremism.
Da’esh is still active, especially its 
ideology, which is still appealing de-
spite its organisational setbacks and ter-
ritorial losses. The threat is even more 
pronounced when taking into consid-
eration other Islamist extremist groups 
ranging from core al-Qaeda and many 
other regional affiliates such as Hay’at 
Tahrir al-Sham, a group which suppos-
edly has thousands of fighters operat-
ing in Syria.
The United States (US) troop with-
drawal and the launch in October 2019 of 
the Turkish military operation in north-
eastern Syria, meant that the Syrian 
Democratic Forces redeployed its forces 
and refocused their operations. Da’esh 
elements immediately tried to capitalise 
on the ensuing vacuum. The US-led op-
eration Inherent Resolve had already re-
ported a resurgence, starting in Q2 2019, 
in Da’esh related incidents in Syria. This 
trend continued throughout the year, 
extending to Iraq as well.
According to a January 2020, United 
Nations (UN) report submitted pursuant 
to resolution 2368 (2017), the reduction 
of US forces raised concerns regarding 
the ability of local security forces cur-
rently active in north-eastern Syria to 
maintain adequate control over a restive 
population of detained Da’esh fighters, 
as well as family members, numbering 
more than 100 000. Many dependants 
remain equally ideologically committed 
and their fate is a major concern for the 
international community. Some 2 000 
foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs) remain 
in detention in the area.
The same UN report adds, Da’esh 
is “mounting increasingly bold insur-
gent attacks, calling and planning for 
the breakout of [Da’esh] fighters in de-
tention facilities and exploiting weak-
nesses in the security environment of 
both countries. The current assessment 
is that the strategic direction of [Da’esh] 
with regard to administration, propa-
ganda and recruitment is unchanged, 
and that command and control between 
the [Da’esh] core in the conflict zone and 
affiliates abroad will be maintained.”
No other predominant conflict zone 
has emerged after the loss of territory 
in Syria and Iraq. Many fighters have 
melted back into the local population 
and have stayed there, while others are 
lying low in certain neighbouring coun-
tries. Others are in less intensive conflict 
zones like Libya and the Sahel.
Depending on developments, some 
may seek to move elsewhere or be di-
rected to do so. Irrespective of whether 
such travelling is sanctioned by the rel-
evant terrorist groups’ structures, the 
use of regular or irregular movements – 
or both – is assessed to depend on a va-
riety of chances and constraints.
External borders and internal 
security
Pre-border checks and border checks re-
main one of the main safeguards of the 
Schengen area and significantly contrib-
ute to guaranteeing the long-term secu-
rity of the Union and its citizens. Such 
checks are carried out in the interest 
of all Member States and the Schengen

Frontex · Risk Analysis for 2020
area. One of the purposes of these checks 
is to prevent any threat to the internal 
security and public policy of the Member 
States, irrespective of the origin of such 
threat – including where such a threat 
derives from Union citizens.
Borders provide challenges but also 
opportunities in countering-terrorism as 
they offer a geographical spread where 
Member States can take executive ac-
tions and pursue prosecutorial or judi-
cial actions. To this end Member States 
and Schengen Associated Countries, 
with the support of JHA Agencies, have 
to make the best use of the legislative 
frameworks that aim to deter, disrupt 
and detect terrorist-related movements 
and detain those involved in terrorist-
related activities.
The amendments to the Schengen 
Borders Code (SBC) and the Schengen In-
formation System (SIS) provision to allow 
Team Members’ access to SIS, plus the 
forthcoming introduction of the Entry-
Exit System (EES), the Electronic Travel 
Information and Authorisation (ETIAS), 
the interoperability between EU informa-
tion systems and the European Search 
Portal (ESP) are all aimed at improving 
such database checks.
Enforcing existing legislation
The EBCG Regulation contextualises 
Frontex’s supporting role in countering 
terrorism. It states that due to its activ-
ities at the external borders, the Agency 
should contribute to the prevention and 
detection of serious crimes with a cross-
border dimension, including terrorism, 
where it is appropriate for it to act and 
where it has obtained relevant informa-
tion through its activities. This is fur-
ther reinforced in Article 3, which lists 
the various European integrated border 
management components.
In regards to before border checks, 
Frontex supports Member States with 
knowledge and guidelines for them to 
make best use of advance information 
systems, such as API and PNR data.
At the borders, Frontex complements 
Member States’ counter-terrorism efforts 
through the Agency’s operations and co-
ordinated activities. Screening, registra-
tion, document checks and debriefing 
activities are part of such efforts. All these 
activities converge on the main goal of 
supporting Member States to identify po-
tential travelling terrorists or ‘subjects of 
interest’ through detailed security checks.
Importantly, the EBCG Regulation of-
fers a tangible way to support Member 
States, especially in times of large and 
sudden or continuous migration flows. 
Article 82§10 (previously 40§8) states that 
“the host Member State shall authorise 
members of the teams to consult Union 
databases, the consultation of which is 
necessary for fulfilling operational aims 
specified in the operational plan on bor-
der checks…”.
The Council conclusions recommend-
ing security checks in the case of irregu-
lar migration (10152/17) list the databases 
that border authorities should systemati-
cally consult to identify known terrorists 
and ‘subjects of interest’. Implemented 
correctly, border activities can sup-
port Member States’ counter-terrorism 
efforts.
Counter-terrorism efforts require that 
the international community at large 
collectively makes the best use of all the 
systems, security databases and sharing 
platforms that are currently in place.

7.1. The EBCG Regulation and Returns
The new European Border and Coast 
Guard Agency Regulation (EU) 2019/1896, 
which came into force in December 2019, 
introduced important changes to Fron-
tex’s mandate, aiming at more effectively 
implementing its Integrated Border Man-
agement strategy. The The EBCG Regula-
tion has, among others, a particular focus 
on the topic of returns, particularly in Ar-
ticles 48 to 53.
The following analysis provides a gen-
eral overview of what Frontex’s new man-
date entails for the field of returns and 
outlines some of the challenges and re-
sponsibilities that the Agency will face 
in the future.
The first European uniformed 
service
In line with the The EBCG Regula-
tion, the Agency will strengthen its op-
erational and technical capacities. The 
most challenging task is the creation of 
the first European uniformed service, set 
to gradually reach 10 000 actively func-
tioning and trained staff by 2027. This 
standing corps will include representa-
tives of Frontex as well as Member States, 
who will be deployed either long term or 
for shorter secondments with the aim 
of providing assistance and support to 
Member States in matters related to mi-
gration management, cooperation with 
third countries, and returns. Deployed 
staff will be fully empowered and will 
have received specific and targeted train-
ing to perform border control as well as 
tasks associated with return.
Articles 52(1) and 53 (2)(3) of the new 
EBCG Regulation allow for the arrange-
ment of return teams, which can be de-
ployed at the Agency’s own initiative or 
upon request or in agreement with host 
Member States. Frontex will provide tech-
nical and operational support for return 
interventions and rapid return interven-
tions. Experts in the field of return will 
be in charge of specific tasks such as, 
for example, assisting Member States in 
the acquisition of travel documents from 
third countries.
Wider scope of support for 
return-related activities
More significantly, the Agency’s re-
mit was widened so that it can now 
offer Member States support also in 
post-arrival and post-return activities. 
Hence, all areas of return are now covered, 
including pre-return activities, assistance 
with voluntary returns and assistance 
for Member States to identify non-EU 
nationals as well as acquire travel docu-
ments by means of consular cooperation 
with third countries.
As set out in Article 48 (2), the support 
and assistance Frontex can now provide 
to Member States is multi-fold, rang-
ing from interpreting services to provid-
ing equipment, resources and expertise 
for identifying potential returnees and 
implementing return decisions. Addi-
tional support is provided in the form of

producing tailored analysis and recom-
mendations on third countries of return.
Enhanced focus on fundamental 
rights
Together with the expanded mandate 
comes increased accountability. The im-
portance of monitoring return opera-
tions is further reinforced in Articles 51 
and 110 (2a) by the introduction of funda-
mental rights monitors that can also act 
as return monitors. Fundamental rights 
monitors are now mandatory for all Fron-
tex operations. They are to be selected 
by the fundamental rights officer and 
should constantly ensure that funda-
mental rights are fully respected in joint 
operations. Return monitors are experts 
who will have received training in fun-
damental rights as well as in other appli-
cable areas in accordance with relevant 
research outcomes and best practices, 
as outlined in Article 62 (1). In particu-
lar cases, return experts will be provided 
with specific training on the protection 
of children and vulnerable persons. Un-
der the general provisions on respect for 
fundamental rights, as laid down in Ar-
ticle 80 of the new EBCG Regulation, the 
legislators once again specified that, in 
line with the principle of non-refoulement, 
no person shall be returned to a country 
where he or she will be subjected to any 
kind of inhumane or degrading treat-
ment. While there is no new information 
in this regard, it is important to remem-
ber that Frontex must always remain in 
compliance with the requirements set 
out by basic international and European 
human rights law.
Improved data collection
In accordance with Article 48 (1d), the 
Agency is finally tasked with the devel-
opment of an integrated return manage-
ment platform that will link the return 
management systems of the Member 
States for the purpose of exchanging data 
and information for analytical as well as 
operational purposes.
The ultimate goal of improved data 
collection on returns is to provide tai-
lored support to Member States by deliv-
ering specific strategic and operational 
products. The quality of such products is 
a consequence of the quality of the data 
collection and how much this reflects re-
ality in the Member States. For this rea-
son, it is fundamental to maintain high 
standards as regards an integrated re-
turn management platform.
Our efforts
A lot of work is still to be done and sev-
eral challenges are waiting ahead, but in 
cooperation with Member States as well 
as with other EU agencies, Frontex will 
continue to make its best efforts to deliver 
tailored support and assistance based on 
the individual needs of the EU countries, 
with a view to ensuring the proper func-
tioning of the European Area of Freedom, 
Security and Justice.

7.2. Changes in Smuggling Services on the Central and Western 
Mediterranean Routes
From 2012 to 2017, Libya was the main 
nexus point where most sub-Saharan 
migrants gathered in order to be smug-
gled across the Mediterranean Sea to Italy 
and further to their countries of destina-
tion in Europe.
In addition, most West African mi-
grants travelled by public transport from 
their countries of origin to Agadez in Ni-
ger and, subsequently, were smuggled to 
Libya. The majority of East African mi-
grants were smuggled first to Khartoum 
in Sudan and then to Libya across the Sa-
hara desert, either directly or via Chad 
or Egypt. In Libya, migrants were trans-
ported to safe houses located mainly in 
the areas of Tripoli, Sabratah or Sabha and 
subsequently smuggled by boat to Italy.
In mid-2018, after the Libyan Coast 
Guard had increased its patrolling ac-
tivities in the Mediterranean Sea and 
the Italian authorities had changed its 
policy regarding SARs, the sea crossings 
from Libya to Italy became increasingly 
50 of 70
Frontex · Risk Analysis for 2020
difficult and expensive for migrants. Con-
sequently, sub-Saharan migrants started 
searching for alternative routes to reach 
Europe. West African migrants started 
travelling to Algeria and Morocco, via 
Mali and Mauritania, and then to Spain 
by boat.
The reduction in the number of mi-
grants smuggled across Libya has appar-
ently reduced the revenue of the people 
smuggling networks that operate in Libya 
and along the routes leading to it.
Information collected during debrief-
ing interviews indicates that in 2017, mi-
grants paid Libyan networks on average 
USD 1 500 per person to be smuggled 
from Libya to Italy by boat. Based on this 
figure and the number of migrants who 
departed from Libya and were appre-
hended by the Italian authorities, it can 
be estimated that the criminal networks 
smuggling migrants to Italy by boat gen-
erated nearly USD 150 million in 2017. In 
mid-2018, the smuggling fees increased 
to EUR 1 800 per person, while the over-
all revenue of the smuggling networks 
decreased to just over EUR 24 million in 
2018, and to over EUR 12 million in 2019.
The people smuggling networks oper-
ating on Libyan territory were led by Lib-
yan nationals who were assisted by other 
smugglers who, in most cases, originated 
from the same country as the migrants. 
In many cases, the Sudanese and Malian 
associates of the Libyan smugglers took 
on the role of enforcer, whereas associ-
ates from other sub-Saharan countries 
took on the role of intermediary between 
the migrants and the criminal groups.
Information collected during debrief-
ing interviews, corroborated with infor-
mation from other sources, indicates that 
many of the armed groups fighting in 
Libya, especially those controlling the 
Zuwarah region, were deeply involved 
in the smuggling of migrants to Italy by 
boat. These groups either directly or in-
directly charged part of the smuggling 
fees obtained by the criminal networks.
Apparently, the significant decrease 
in estimated revenue resulting from mi-
grant smuggling (i.e. from USD 150 mil-
lion in 2017 to less than USD 3 million 
in 2019) had a limited effect on the mil-
itary capabilities and power of the Lib-
yan armed groups involved in these 
illegal activities. This may be an indica-
tor that these armed groups have alter-
native sources of financing that can easily 
cover such a significant loss.
Conversely, the shift in the flow of 
West African migrants from Libya to-
wards Morocco and Algeria, has sig-
nificantly increased the revenue of the 
criminal groups involved in the smug-
gling of migrants from these two coun-
tries to Europe.
More specifically, during 2017 and the 
first half of 2018, migrants paid between 
EUR 500 and EUR 1 000 to be smuggled 
from Algeria to Spain and between EUR 
1 000 and EUR 2 000 from Morocco to 
Spain. Since mid-2018, smuggling fees 
have grown on the Western Mediterra-
nean route and by Q4 of 2019 the fee had 
reached EUR 3 000 per person. Based on 
these data and the number of migrants 
detected on the Western Mediterranean 
route it can be estimated1 that in 2017 
the people smuggling networks operat-
ing in Morocco gained nearly EUR 35 mil-
lion, and their revenue grew to roughly 
EUR 105 million in 2018, and EUR 19 mil-
lion in 2019.
Another effect of the growing demand 
for smuggling services in Morocco and Al-
geria was that these services have become 
increasingly diverse and sophisticated. 
Also, the number of smugglers involved 
in these activities has increased, espe-
cially those originating from the same 
countries as migrants.
Practically, the criminal networks 
operating in Morocco and Algeria have 
constantly scaled up their capabilities 
to smuggle an increasing number of mi-
grants, thus increasing the migratory 
1 It is more difficult to estimate the 
financial gains of the criminal groups 
operating in Morocco and Algeria because 
the smuggling fees paid by migrants can 
vary depending on many factors, such as: 
the services included in the agreement 
(e.g. safe house, food, flight ticket, life 
vest), the means of transport used and 
their seaworthiness (e.g. toy boat vs. jet 
ski vs. Zodiac), and the departure location.
threat on the Western Mediterranean 
route. In the future, these criminal net-
works might use their increased capa-
bilities to expand their illegal activities 
to other crimes such as money launder-
ing, corruption and smuggling of goods.
Nevertheless, as the smuggling fees 
continue to rise on the Western Med-
iterranean route, an increasing num-
ber of migrants might find this route 
unaffordable and search for alternative 
routes. Should any relevant factor be al-
tered, the Central Mediterranean route 
could become attractive again for sub-
Saharan migrants.

7.3.  Security risks of blacklisted flag vessels (BLVs) under the 
Paris MoU on port state control
The European Union has an exten-
sive maritime area that stretches along 
44 000 km of external sea borders. Its 
shipping lanes (some of the busiest in 
the world) and more than 300 seaports 
are vital for the bloc’s economic growth 
and prosperity – EU ports handle 400 
million passengers per year, 74% of goods 
traded by the EU enter or exit via the sea 
and 40% of its internal trade takes place 
via maritime flows.
The EU’s maritime environment there-
fore offers valuable opportunities, but 
it also poses significant risks. Some of 
the major threats to the EU’s security 
(cross-border crime, terrorism and ille-
gal migration) have an important mar-
itime dimension, which consequently 
calls for a strong and effective maritime 
security strategy to properly address and 
manage such threats.
One risk to the EU’s security concerns 
the presence of so-called blacklisted flag 
vessels (BLVs) in EU ports. BLVs are ships 
registered in countries that have been 
blacklisted by the Paris Memorandum 
of Understanding on Port State Control 
(Paris MoU on PSC) on the basis of port 
state control inspections.
The Paris MoU on PSC was created 
in 1982 following a  large-scale disaster 
at sea, namely, the sinking of the crude 
carrier Amoco Cadiz in 1978. Although, 
prior to the signing of the Paris MoU on 
PSC, rules were in place to regulate the 
working conditions for crews and to en-
sure compliance with the demands of the 
International Labour Organisation, the 
Amoco Cadiz catastrophe highlighted the 
need for more extensive regulations on 
safety and pollution. Today, the Paris MoU 
on PSC comprises the maritime admin-
istrations of 26 European countries and 
Canada with the aim of controlling the 
use of substandard ships (e.g. those that 
do not meet the required international 
safety and security standards) through 
a uniform approach to port state control.
In 2018, the following 13 states world-
wide were blacklisted by the Paris MoU 
on PSC: Belize, Cambodia, Comoros, Cook 
Islands, Democratic Republic of Congo, 
Moldova, Palau, Saint Kitts and Nevis, 
Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Togo, Vanuatu 
and Ukraine. In 2019, two new states – 
Albania and Mongolia – were added to 
the black list, while Vanuatu was moved 
to the grey list.
Notably, for 95% of BLVs, the 13 black-
listed countries represented flags of con-
venience – a business practice whereby 
ship owners register their ships in the 
registries of other countries where 
compliance with international laws may 
be less strictly observed. This is a legal - 
albeit controversial - practice, particularly 
as some countries’ registries are operated 
by private companies that provide a fast 
and easy process with few or no restric-
tions to registration. Unsurprisingly, the 
practice may also result in the registra-
tion of substandard vessels used for il-
licit activities at sea.
According to data on the BLV fleet 
available to Frontex for 2018, a total of 
3 128 vessels (3% of the total global fleet) 
were registered in the 13 blacklisted flag 
states. The present analysis provides 
a closer look at this vessel population 
and considers the risks they pose to the 
EU’s security.

Breakdown of BLVs by country of registration, 2018
Profile of blacklisted flag vessels
Vessels registered in the 13 blacklisted 
flag states displayed a uniform profile: 
smaller and older vessels compared with 
the world’s fleet representing three main 
types (i.e. general cargo, service vessels 
and tankers). Specifically, cargo ves-
sels made up the largest group of BLVs, 
accounting for half of the entire BLV 
population. This class included a high pro-
portion of general cargo vessels, as well 
as an important share of bulk and live-
stock carriers. As the second main class, 
service vessels represented close to one-
fifth of all BLVs, and comprised mostly 
tugs, supply vessels and anchor handling 
vessels. Tankers represented one in seven 
BLVs and included a large number of oil 
tankers (almost half). Together, the three 
classes – cargo ships, service vessels and 
tankers – made up 88% of the entire BLV 
population in 2018.
BLVs were generally small in size – 
more than three-fifths were below 7k 
tonnage and rarely exceeded 10k ton-
nage, whereas, in comparison, less than 
half of the global merchant fleet was this 
small. Similarly, while three-fifths of BLVs 
measured up to 100 metres in length, 
only two-fifths of the global vessel popu-
lation were this size. Furthermore, more 
than 63% of BLVs were over 20 years old, 
and 76% were more than 10 years old. As 
regards the global fleet, 56% of vessels 
were less than 20 years old.
BLVs were thus usually smaller and 
older than most ships in the global fleet. 
This is an important finding because the 
age, size and type of BLVs are determin-
ing factors for their involvement in illicit 
activities. Since smaller ships are easier 
to operate and older ships have a lower 
market value and more difficulty in stay-
ing economically competitive at sea, they 
tend to be more attractive to criminals. 
BLVs are therefore potentially more likely 
to be involved in illicit activities than reg-
ular ships (e.g. at the beginning of 2018, 
the Greek Coast Guard seized a Tanza-
nia-registered general cargo off the is-
land of Crete, carrying explosives destined 
to Libya1; towards the end of the year, 
Spanish Police officers apprehended 1 
400 kilos of cocaine from a tugboat reg-
istered in Moldova, navigating in the At-
lantic Ocean, off the southwestern coast 
of Spain2).
Mitigating the risk of BLVs to 
the EU’s maritime security
The involvement of BLVs in illicit activ-
ities has been well-documented, forc-
ing certain countries to take measures 
to protect their registries. In 2016, for 
example, the government of Cambodia 
closed its flag of convenience scheme af-
ter foreign ships registered in the coun-
try were found to be involved in drug and 
arms smuggling and human trafficking. 
Earlier in 2013, the European Commis-
sion banned seafood imports into the 
EU from Cambodia and Belize in view of 
illegal fishing by ships registered in the 
two countries, further proving the mis-
use of the two countries’ registries by 
foreign ships.
According to the Paris MoU’s current 
list of banned ships, as of mid-Febru-
ary 2020, 110 ships are banned from the 
Paris MoU region due to their poor safety

record, out of which 77% are registered in 
a blacklisted flag-state. This finding also 
suggests the potential risk of BLVs for the 
security of the Paris MoU region.
In 2018, close to 1 000 vessels flying 
different blacklisted flags made more 
than 15  000 calls to EU ports. While 
their presence in EU waters per se does 
not indicate their involvement in an il-
legal activity (many BLVs are involved in 
legitimate business and present no secu-
rity and safety risk), it is important that 
EU countries are able to detect and in-
tercept those vessels whose voyages to 
the EU do not have a legitimate purpose.
As the European Border and Coast 
Guard Agency, Frontex will continue to 
deal with the security risks posed by BLVs 
in the framework of its Multipurpose 
Maritime Operations and the EUROSUR 
Fusion Services for Border Surveillance, 
supporting the competent authorities of 
the Member States accordingly.

7.4. In Focus: Secondary Movements by Sea Throughout 2019
EU migration in recent years has become 
closely associated with arrivals of third-
country nationals, often in overcrowded 
and unseaworthy boats. While crossings 
of external sea borders are an important 
part of EU migration, there are also other 
relevant aspects. For many migrants and 
asylum seekers, the initial sea voyage to 
Europe is just the beginning. After ar-
rival, many try to continue their journey 
to their desired destination, travelling in 
an irregular manner between countries 
in the EU and Schengen area (secondary 
movements).
For irregular migrants and asylum 
seekers who do not wish to stay in the 
first country of arrival and for whom trav-
elling by land or air may not be viable, 
travelling by sea may be the only way to 
get to their intended destination. Despite 
the inherent risks, many third-country 
nationals are eager to attempt sea cross-
ings. In 2019 secondary movements by 
sea continued to be reported across the 
EU; they were mostly concentrated in 
the North Sea, Baltic and Mediterranean.
North Sea/English Channel
In 2019 the North Sea and English Chan-
nel remained a key area for secondary 
movements by sea. The movements were 
largely towards the United Kingdom, 
which has long been an attractive desti-
nation for third-country nationals. While 
such movements to the UK are not a re-
cent phenomenon, they gained prom-
inence in the past few years and saw 
a diversification of modi operandi and na-
tionalities. The increased volume of sec-
ondary movements across these seaways 
may have been in part attributed to the 
UK’s departure from the EU, which stoked 
fears among migrants and asylum seek-
ers that reaching the United Kingdom 
would become increasingly difficult af-
ter Brexit, and heightened the sense of 
urgency to reach the country.
Despite the various modi operandi em-
ployed for the sea crossings, in 2019 the 
most common method remained hiding 
third-country nationals in the backs of 
lorries bound for the United Kingdom. 
While highly popular among migrants 
and facilitators, this modus operandi often 
comes at a great cost to human life due 
to the dangerous concealment methods 
used (i.e. refrigerated lorries and sealed 
containers). The tragic consequences 
that can ensue from clandestine entry 
attempts were illustrated by the death 
of 39 Vietnamese nationals whose bod-
ies were found at an industrial park in 
Essex inside a refrigerated lorry that had 
departed from the port of Zeebrugge in 
Belgium.
Last year, the vast majority of those 
detected attempting to cross the North 
Sea and English Channel clandestinely 
were adult males from Eritrea, Albania 
and Sudan, followed by North African 
and Middle Eastern nationalities such 
as Algerians, Iraqis, Afghans and Liby-
ans. Though in much fewer numbers, 
attempts by females were also reported, 
in particular from Eritrea, and to a lesser 
extent from Vietnam, India, Iraq and Af-
ghanistan. Nearly one in every five per-
sons detected travelling clandestinely 
were children (mostly boys). Here again, 
Eritreans made up the largest group and 
were followed by children from Sudan, 
Vietnam, Afghanistan, Albania and Iraq. 
Three-fifths of reported children travelled 
unaccompanied, with the majority orig-
inating from Eritrea.
A further modus operandi that continued 
to be widely employed for sea crossings in 
the North Sea and English Channel con-
cerned the use of fraudulent documents 
by third-country nationals travelling by 
ferry. However, given the cost of procur-
ing fraudulent documents, not everyone 
could afford this method – one-third of 
all users were from Albania, followed by 
Iraqis and Iranians, and to a  large ex-
tent they used false ID cards as well as 
false passports.
In 2019 the English Channel be-
came especially notorious for migrants’ 
attempts to cross in small boats, a trend 
that began towards the end of 2018 and 
rose sharply in 2019, likely as a result of 
reinforced security measures and more 
stringent border checks which made at-
tempts to stow away in lorries more diffi-
cult. Many of the third-country nationals 
that attempted the illegal boat crossings 
came from Iran and Afghanistan. This mo-
dus operandi poses substantial risks to mi-
grants’ and asylum seekers’ lives – not 
only is the English Channel one of the 
busiest shipping lanes in the world, but 
the boats used are small and unfit for pur-
pose, lacking the necessary equipment to 
guarantee a safe crossing. For those who 
make it, the risk of exploitation and hu-
man trafficking remains a possibility if 
opportunities for legal work in the UK 
are not available.
Mediterranean Sea
Although the Mediterranean is largely 
known as an entry route for migrants 
and asylum seekers wanting to reach Eu-
rope, it is also extensively used by a num-
ber of third-country nationals who aim 
to reach a country different from that of 
arrival. In particular, the sea route from 
Greece to Western European countries has 
gained increasing importance as an alter-
native for irregular migrants and asylum 
seekers looking to circumvent the over-
land Western Balkan route since its clo-
sure in 2016.
Last year, the Mediterranean contin-
ued to experience intense intra-Schengen 
movements from Greece. The modi operandi 
used were largely comparable to those 
observed in the North Sea and English 
Channel. Many third-country nationals 
attempted to travel clandestinely by hid-
ing in trucks, cars, vans, buses and fer-
ries. This method was most commonly 
used by males from Afghanistan, Iraq 
and Iran, and to a lesser extent from Al-
bania and Turkey. Overall, few children 
were detected travelling clandestinely; 
54 of 70
Frontex · Risk Analysis for 2020
almost all cases reported concerned Iraqi 
and Afghan children.
As regards third-country nationals 
who boarded ferries in a bid to reach 
Western Europe, many were in posses-
sion of fraudulent documents, such as 
false passports, false ID cards and (less 
so) residence permits. These included to 
a large extent Syrians, Turks, Afghans and 
Iraqis. There were also cases of ferry pas-
sengers travelling without documents.
Baltic Sea
Although the Baltic Sea was the least af-
fected of the three regions by secondary 
movements by sea, last year it experi-
enced a surge in movements from Cen-
tral European countries and, to a lesser 
extent, Baltic States, towards Scandina-
via. Secondary movements by sea across 
this region concerned mostly Ukraini-
ans, but also some nationals of Central 
Asian countries (Uzbekistan and Kyr-
gyzstan) and other European countries 
(Georgia, Belarus and Russia). While the 
main mode of travelling was ferry, detec-
tions suggest that many travelled with-
out the necessary documentation, as well 
as with fraudulent documents or without 
a valid visa or residence permit. The fact 
that the vast majority of irregular trav-
ellers in this region were male, coupled 
with increases over the summer, implies 
that such movements were associated 
with seasonal migrant labour.
Other relevant movements by sea from 
Central Europe to Scandinavia included 
those by Syrians, Iraqis, Afghans, Eri-
treans and Somalis. Movements in the 
opposite direction were rarely reported.
Facilitation of secondary 
movements
The high number of irregular migrants 
and asylum seekers present in EU terri-
tory and the strengthening of law en-
forcement and border management 
measures has led to the establishment 
of organised crime groups dedicated 
to the facilitation of secondary move-
ments across all types of border. Their 
business model is largely founded on the 
exploitation of migrants’ aspirations for 
a brighter future in a new country, and 
often conducted without any regard for 
the lives of those they are meant to be 
assisting. With the stepping up of meas-
ures to dissuade dangerous irregular 
movements between EU and Schengen 
Associated Countries and reduced oppor-
tunities for clandestine attempts, there 
is an increased risk of facilitated second-
ary movements.
In order to more effectively tackle risky 
movements of irregular migrants and 
asylum seekers and ensure their safety, 
cooperation at national and EU level is 
pivotal. In this regard, Frontex will con-
tinue to actively support Member States, 
not only in ensuring well-functioning ex-
ternal borders, but also in providing oper-
ational support where it is most needed 
and collaborating with other Agencies 
and Bodies of the European Union to en-
sure that the EU’s internal security and 
the area of freedom, security and justice 
are guaranteed. Last but not least, anal-
ysis will remain an important aspect of 
Frontex’s work in the area of secondary 
movements in years to come. The use of 
EUROSUR as the main framework for 
information exchange and cooperation 
between the Agency and Member States 
(as envisaged under the new EBCG Reg-
ulation) will thus be crucial in fulfilling 
this role, helping Frontex to maintain an 
up-to-date and accurate European situa-
tional picture on the phenomenon.

8. Outlook and conclusions 
Looking at the possible evolution of the 
situation at the EU external border, some 
developments are likely whereas oth-
ers are possible. Past experience dem-
onstrates that there are a large number 
of unforeseeable events and factors that 
can have a profound and unpredictable 
impact on the situation at the border.
The likely
2019 was the year irregular arrivals 
bottomed out
2019 was characterised by destabilising 
trends in key countries of origin – in 
particular in countries bordering Tur-
key and thus in direct proximity to the 
Eastern Mediterranean route. While the 
migratory movement from most of these 
countries is gradual, the risk of sudden, 
large-scale outflows from Syria remains. 
The Idlib region of Syria has seen hun-
dreds of thousands of refugees amass-
ing on the Turkish border. According to 
the UN, from 1 December 2019 to mid-
February an estimated 900 000 people 
were displaced from Idlib, most of them 
women and children. Not all that far 
away, at the EU external border, a tense 
situation developed from the end of Feb-
ruary 2020 onward. Other key regions of 
origin are currently experiencing major 
upheavals as well, for instance the locust 
plague in East Africa is threatening the 
livelihood of millions. Considering these 
factors, and in view of the slowing rate 
of decrease of migrant arrivals in recent 
years, 2019 may well stand out as the year 
when the number of illegal border-cross-
ings bottomed out.
Migrants organise to challenge border 
regimes
2019 saw multiple instances of attempts 
by migrants to organise themselves to 
successfully cross the EU’s external bor-
ders. These attempts were organised 
through social media messaging services 
and are often described as ‘caravans’ in 
reference to the Central American phe-
nomenon in 2017/18 and in particular 
observed in the Western Balkans. 2020 
has already witnessed several instances, 
which were closely monitored by Frontex. 
The ease with which these kinds of ral-
lies can be organised on social media sug-
gests that these occurrences may increase 
in the future, potentially with the goal 
of overwhelming border authorities or 
even forcing their way onto EU territory.
Cross-border crime
Cross-border crime remains by all esti-
mates a profitable venture and as such 
will continue to occur at the EU’s ex-
ternal borders. Heterogeneous weapon 
laws in the EU will continue to attract 
the smuggling of weapons and ammu-
nition both within the EU and across its 
external borders. New aspects like the 
availability of illicit goods on the dark-
net and deliveries in small parcels will 
affect these crime fields. Closer cooper-
ation between customs services, border 
guards, law enforcement authorities and 
(profile-based) targeted checks could ad-
dress these developments going forward.
56 of 70
Frontex · Risk Analysis for 2020
Generally speaking, given the complex 
nature of cross-border crime, comprehen-
sive operational responses are required. 
Therefore, risk mitigation measures by 
Member States and Frontex at the EU’s 
external borders need to be based on the 
findings of risk analysis and identified 
criminal threats. Besides risk analysis 
support, the Agency may provide techni-
cal and operational assistance to Mem-
ber States to reinforce their capacity to 
fulfil their obligations with regard to the 
control of the external borders and to 
face challenges resulting from cross-bor-
der crime.
The possible
Reversal of upward trend of passenger 
flows
Rising legal passenger flows across the 
EU’s external borders year-on-year seem 
to have been almost a given in recent 
years. With global mobility on the rise, 
the growing demand is being met by an 
expanding supply of cheap travel options. 
However, there are a number of factors 
that suggest a reversal of this trend (al-
beit probably temporary) is at hand, on 
both the demand and supply side.
Firstly, the outbreak of the Coronavi-
rus disease (COVID-19) has already put 
a dent in global mobility. At the time of 
writing, countless people have been put 
under quarantine globally, with airlines 
suspending numerous connections. Major 
international events have been cancelled. 
Travellers are growing more careful in 
light of the pandemic as the WHO clas-
sified it. Others may be falling victim to 
what has been termed the ‘infodemic’.
Secondly, there is a real possibility 
that climate change concerns may soon 
translate into hefty CO2 emission prices 
which may considerably raise the prices 
of transportation. In addition, demand 
could well suffer, too, if consumers start 
changing their behaviour.
Brexit creates new challenges for EU 
border management
The UK has traditionally been and is likely 
to remain a prime destination country for 
migrants. Uncertainty about Brexit has 
in fact increased the resolve of migrants 
to get to the UK recently, resulting in an 
increase in migrant boats in the English 
Channel, clandestine entry attempts on 
lorries and even attempts to enter the 
UK aboard cruise ships. As the future re-
lationship between the UK and the EU is 
negotiated during the transition period, 
the level of formalised cross-border coop-
eration will be a key determinant of the 
future challenges to EU integrated border 
management. Bilaterally good examples 
of cooperation already exist in the North 
Sea region. The UK is not only a destina-
tion country for migrants, it also plays 
a significant role as a market for drugs 
and illegal firearms. Hence Brexit – with 
different border and customs controls – 
will influence the development of cross-
border crime, too.
The unknown
The coronavirus and border controls
The coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has 
had far-reaching consequences beyond 
the impact on passenger flows (as dis-
cussed above). Given the increasing prev-
alence of the disease, proper contingency 
planning and precautionary measures are 
essential in order to mitigate the worst 
effects of the disease. Beyond the mul-
tifaceted effects on the European Border 
and Coast Guard described in 6.2, the 
spread of COVID-19 has also set in mo-
tion dynamics that are, for the time be-
ing, still difficult to evaluate in terms 
of their potential impact on European 
border management. As even the most 
developed countries with sophisticated 
healthcare systems are struggling to deal 
with the pandemic and are often passing 
unparalleled measures that rely to some 
extent on societal/public trust, the effects 
on whole regions of the globe without 
proper governance, adequate healthcare 
systems or an appropriate economic ar-
senal to deploy against the pandemic are 
entirely unclear. 
Some regimes may be unable to main-
tain order and the outbreak of internal 
and inter-state conflict could occur, po-
tentially creating new displaced popula-
tions or irregular migration, possibly also 
moving towards Europe. 
Many other scenarios are conceivable. 
For instance, infected people from devel-
oping countries might seek medical care 
in Europe – regardless of the risk of in-
fecting others in the chosen country of 
destination. 
Finally, until such a time that a via-
ble, scalable vaccine is available, the vi-
rus will continue to encircle the globe, 
making it necessary to thoroughly re-
orientate border management towards 
health screening.
Migration within the geopolitical 
context
Increased geopolitical competition in the 
Mediterranean is clearly visible from the 
ferocity with which foreign powers have 
been moving into Libya to side with ei-
ther faction in the ongoing conflict. Com-
petition for natural resources like offshore 
gas is just one of many interests at stake. 
Given the actors involved, the geopolitics 
of the Central Mediterranean may well 
result in the use or threat of the use of 
migration as a bargaining chip.

Notes on FRAN data sources and methods 
The term ‘Member States’ refers to FRAN 
Member States, which includes the 28 
Member States and three Schengen As-
sociated Countries (Iceland, Norway and 
Switzerland) as of 2019. For the data con-
cerning detections at the external bor-
ders of the EU, some of the border types 
are not applicable to all FRAN Member 
States. This pertains to data on all FRAN 
indicators since the data are provided 
disaggregated by border type. The defi-
nitions of detections at land borders are 
therefore not applicable (excluding bor-
ders with non-Schengen principalities) 
for Belgium, the Czech Republic, Den-
mark, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, 
Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Nether-
lands, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland 
and the UK. For Cyprus, the land bor-
der refers to the Green Line demarcation 
with the area where the Government 
of the Republic of Cyprus does not ex-
ercise effective control. For sea borders, 
the definitions are not applicable for 
land-locked Member States including 
Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Luxembourg, Slovakia and Switzerland. 
In addition, data on detections of il-
legal border-crossing at land, air and sea 
BCPs (1B) are not available for Iceland 
and Ireland. 
Data on detections of illegal border-
crossing between sea BCPs (1A) are not 
available for Ireland and Sweden. For 
2013, data from Slovenia include detec-
tions at the EU external borders only un-
til June 2013. 
Data on apprehension (FRAN Indica-
tor 2) of facilitators are not available for 
Ireland and UK. For Italy Norway, Spain 
and Sweden,, the data are not disaggre-
gated by border type, but are reported 
as total apprehensions (not specified). 
Data for Italy and Norway also include 
the facilitation of illegal stay and work. 
For Romania, the data include land In-
tra-EU detections on exit at the border 
with Hungary. 
For the data concerning detections 
of illegal stay (FRAN Indicator 3), data 
on detections on exit are not available 
for France, Ireland Portugal, and Spain. 
Data on detections of illegal stay inland 
have not been available from the Neth-
erlands since 2012. 
Data on refusals of entry (FRAN In-
dicator 4) at the external EU borders are 
not disaggregated by reason of refusal for 
Ireland and the UK. 
The data on passenger flow (shared on 
voluntary basis) are not available for Aus-
tria, Ireland, Sweden and the UK. Data on 
passenger flow at the air border are not 
available according to the definition for 
Spain. Data at the sea border are not avail-
able for Denmark, Estonia, France, Latvia, 
the Netherlands and Norway. 
For all indicators, data from Croatia 
are available only starting with July 2013.
