Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training, operations and research,
each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis publications bear a triangular symbol formed
by an arrow drawing a triangle, with a dot at the centre. Meta­phorically, the arrow represents the cyclical
nature of risk analysis processes and its orienta­tion towards an appropriate operational response. The tri­
angle is a symbol of ideal proportions and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit of factual exactness, truth and
exhaustive analysis. The dot at the centre represents the intelligence factor and the focal point where informa­
tion from diverse sources converges to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical products. Thus,
Frontex risk analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable ba­sis for its operational activities.

         Most detections were reported from the
         islands of Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros
         and Kos, though the number of islands
         targeted by the smuggling groups is
         growing. As resources at the border are
         increasingly stretched in order to attend
         to unprecedented numbers of arrivals,
         it is also more likely that an unknown
         number of mi­grants cross undetected.
             With the rapid increase in the num­

         smugglers are becoming more and more

   Security risks associated with continued recognition of Syrian passports

   The massive migration inflow of 2015 raised many questions related to the identity of arriving people. Concerns re-
   lated to the abuse of Syrian documents have been confirmed by the observations made during the regis­tration pro­
   cess. The level of security of the Syrian supporting documents (in particu­lar ID cards, family books, military books,
   etc.) is very low. Forgeries detected dur­ing the registration process are of different quality, although most of these doc­
   uments could be detected during proper docu­ment checks.
       The situation is much more complex in the case of the abuse of Syrian passports. Although the protection level
   of these doc­uments is relatively low compared to EU passports, the big­gest problem lies in the security (and the over­
   all reliability) of the issuing process. Criminal organisations have access to a large number of stolen blank Syrian pass­
   ports and printers used for their per­sonalisation. This allows them to produce genuine-looking passports, which may
   be difficult to identify even by experienced document experts.
       The very unreliable and non-secure issu­ing process of Syrian passports together with the very low security pro-
   tection of the Syrian breeder (supporting) docu­ments would normally lead to non-recog­nition of Syrian passports
   for the purpose of travel. Recently issued ordinary Syr­ian passports are, however, recognised for travel and for affix­
   ing a visa by all EU Member States. By contrast, similarly unreliable passports of Somalia are not recognised by most
   EU Member States.

Please note that the number of effective returns may sometimes be larger than return decisions, as a return decision issued in a given month may be effectively enforced at a later date. Also, return decisions may be issued
without prejudice to the person’s right to apply for asylum. Returns between Member States are not included (for example between France and Italy). Effective returns do not necessarily mean returns to the country of origin
and, for example in the case of Syrians, they include returns of persons to third countries considered to be safe (for example from Hungary to Serbia).
