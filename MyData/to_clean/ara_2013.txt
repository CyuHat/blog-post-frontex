          Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training, operations and
          research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis publications bear a trian-
          gular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with a dot at the centre. Metaphorically,
          the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk analysis processes and its orientation towards an
          appropriate operational response. The triangle is a symbol of ideal proportions and knowledge,
          reflecting the pursuit of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive analysis. The dot at the centre
          represents the intelligence factor and the focal point where information from diverse sources
          converges to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical products. Thus, Frontex risk
          analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable basis for its operational activities.

           Indicator 5 – Applications for international protection (asylum applications):
           The number of third-country nationals having submitted an application for international protection or having been included in
           such an application (e.g. as a family member) during the reference month (see Article 4.1 of Regulation (EC) No 862/2007 of
           11 July 2007). Each applicant for international protection must be recorded only once within the same reference month. This
           indicator concerns applications submitted to Member State authorities at the external border as well as applications submitted
           inside the territory. It is the number of new applications which have been submitted exclusively during the reporting month (in
           contrast to the total number of applications under consideration in a country at a certain time). It should include all applications
           for international protection such as for refugee status, subsidiary or temporary protection, etc. This indicator should not include
           EU or Schengen Associated Country (SAC) nationals.

Indicator 6 – Persons using false travel documents for entering the territory illegally:
The number of persons who were detected by Member State authorities during border checks at BCPs who attempted
to use false travel documents, false visas or false permissions to stay for the purpose of entering the territory. All cases
of falsifications (forged, counterfeit, substitution of photo or name, fantasy documents, etc.) have to be included. The
category concerns only those persons who used false passports, identity cards, residence or work permits, visas, etc., i.e.
types of documents of which genuine versions would be valid for entering. Cases in which other types of documents have
been used, such as false driving licences, false boarding passes or false supporting documents should not be included in
this category. This indicator should include third-country nationals as well as EU and Schengen Associated Country (SAC)
nationals.
