Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training, operations and 
research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis publications bear a trian-
gular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with a dot at the centre. Metaphorically, 
the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk analysis processes and its orientation towards an 
appropriate operational response. The triangle is a symbol of ideal proportions and knowledge, 
reflecting the pursuit of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive analysis. The dot at the centre 
represents the intelligence factor and the focal point where information from diverse sources 
converges to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical products. Thus, Frontex risk 
analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable basis for its operational activities.

Detections of illegal border-crossing along 
the EU’s external borders dropped sharply 
in 2012 to about 73 000, i.e. half the num-
ber reported in 2011. This was the first time 
since systematic data collection began in 
2008 that annual detections have plunged 
under 100 000. 
In the Central Mediterranean area, the large 
number of detections in 2011, which suddenly 
increased following the Arab Spring in Tunisia 
and Libya, had been significantly reduced by 
the end of 2011. However, throughout 2012, 
detections steadily increased and by the end 
of the year they totalled more than 10 300.
Starting from 2008, considerable numbers 
of migrants had been detected crossing ille-
gally the border between Turkey and Greece, 
along the so-called Eastern Mediterranean 
route. The situation changed dramatically in 
August 2012 when the Greek authorities mo-
bilised unprecedented resources at their land 
border with Turkey, including the deployment 
of 1 800 additional Greek police officers. The 
number of detected illegal border-crossings 
rapidly dropped from about 2 000 in the first 
week of August to below 10 per week in Oc-
tober 2012.
The enhanced controls along the Greek-Turk-
ish land border led to a moderate increase in 
detections of illegal border-crossing in the 
Aegean Sea and at the land border between 
Bulgaria and Turkey, but simultaneous mitiga-
tion efforts in Turkey and Bulgaria have so far 
contained the displacements. There remains 
the risk of resurgence of irregular migration, 
since many migrants may be waiting for the 
conclusion of the Greek operations before 
they continue their journey towards Europe.
Many migrants who cross the border ille-
gally to Greece move on to other Member 
States, mostly through the land route across 
the Western Balkans. Contrary to the de-
crease at the Greek-Turkish land border, there 
was no decrease in detections of illegal bor-
der-crossing on the Western Balkan route 
(6 390, +37%).
In 2012, in the Western Mediterranean area 
between North Africa and Spain, detections 
of illegal border-crossing decreased by nearly 
a quarter compared to 2011 but remained 
above the levels recorded in previous years 
(6 400, -24%). 
In 2012, Afghans remained the most detected 
nationality for illegal border-crossing at EU 
level, but their number considerably dropped 
compared to 2011. Syrians stand out, with 
large increases in detections of illegal border-
crossing and for using fraudulent documents 
compared to 2011. Most of the detected Syr-
ians applied for asylum in the EU, fleeing the 
civil war in their country.
There were large increases in refusals of en-
try at the Polish land border with Belarus and 
Executive summary

5 of 80
Ukraine. However, these increases were off-
set by a decrease in refusals of entry issued 
at other border sections, resulting in a sta-
ble total at EU level compared to 2011 (-3%, 
115 000 refusals of entry).
Detections of illegal stayers, which totalled 
about 350 000 in the EU in 2012, have shown 
a stable but slightly declining long-term trend 
since 2008. Most migrants detected illegally 
staying in the EU were from Afghanistan and 
Morocco.
Despite a short-term increase of 10% between 
2011 and 2012, the overall trend of detections 
of facilitators of irregular migration has been 
falling since 2008, totalling about 7 700 in 
2012. This long-term decline may be in part 
due to a widespread shift towards the abuse 
of legal channels (such as overstaying, abuse 
of visa-free regime, etc.) and document fraud, 
which results in facilitators being able to op-
erate remotely and inconspicuously.
In 2012, there were around 8 000 detections 
of migrants using fraudulent documents to 
enter the EU or Schengen area illegally. 
Preliminary data on asylum applications in 
2012 indicate an overall increase of about 7% 
compared to the previous year. While Afghans 
continue to account for the largest share of 
applications, much of the increase was due 
to an increasing number of applications sub-
mitted by Syrian nationals. 
The number of asylum applications submitted 
in the EU by Western Balkan citizens, mostly 
those from Serbia, remained unabated in 2012. 
Consequently, following the implementation 
of the visa facilitation agreement with five 
Western Balkan countries that started at 
the end of 2009, there are now discussions 
in the EU about the possible reintroduction 
of the visa regime.
In 2012, there was a steady trend of about 
160 000 third-country nationals effectively 
returned to third countries. Greece reported 
the largest number of returns of a single na-
tionality (Albanians), and effective returns in 
Greece increased markedly in the last quar-
ter of 2012 following the launch of the Xenios 
Zeus operation.
Looking ahead, the assessment of risks along 
the EU’s external borders shows that despite 
a sharp reduction in detections between 2011 
and 2012, the risks associated with illegal bor-
der-crossing along the land and sea external 
borders remain among the highest, in par-
ticular in the southern section of the bor-
der of the EU. 
The risk of illegal border-crossing along the 
land borders of the Eastern Mediterranean 
route, including the Greek and Bulgarian land 
border with Turkey, is assessed amongst the 
highest. This comes after several years of large 
numbers of migrants detected at the Greek 
land border with Turkey. Although the flow 
abruptly stopped in August 2012, there are re-
ports of uncertainties related to the sustaina-
bility of the efforts and growing evidence that 
migrants are waiting in Turkey for the end of 
the operation. Increases at the neighbouring 
sea border (Aegean Sea), at the land border 
between Bulgaria and Turkey and increases 
in detections of document fraud from Istan-
bul airports, although so far relatively small, 
indicate that alternatives to the Greek land 
border are being explored by facilitators.
Many of the migrants who crossed illegally 
through the Eastern Mediterranean route 
are expected to continue making secondary 
movements across the Western Balkans and 
within the EU. 
The risk of illegal border-crossing across the 
Central Mediterranean area was also assessed 
amongst the highest due the continued vol-
atile situation in countries of departure in 
Frontex · annual risk analysis 2013 
6 of 80
North Africa. Crisis situations are still likely to 
arise at the southern border with thousands 
of people trying to cross the border illegally 
in the span of several weeks or months. Past 
experiences also show that these crises take 
their toll on human lives, and are very diffi-
cult to predict and quell without a coordi-
nated response. 
Most risks associated with document fraud 
were assessed as high. Indeed, document 
fraudsters not only undermine border se-
curity but also the internal security of the 
EU. These risks are also common to nearly 
all Member States, as they are associated 
with passenger flows and border checks, 
which are a specific expertise of border-
control authorities.
Fraud is expected mostly among EU travel 
documents (e.g. passports, visas and ID cards).
False pretence or deception is used to ob-
tain a wide range of documents. The most 
common technique is to use fraudulent doc-
uments to obtain short-term visas.
Most risks associated with the abuse 
of legal channels are assessed as high 
as they are common and widely spread 
phenomena. 
Based on currently available information, the 
risks associated with cross-border criminal-
ity are assessed as moderate, including the 
risks of trafficking in human beings, terror-
ism, smuggling of illicit drugs and exit of sto-
len vehicles.

The Annual Risk Analysis 2013 is intended to 
facilitate and contribute to informed decisions 
on investments and concerted actions that 
are most likely to have sustainable effects on 
the management of the external borders and 
ultimately on the internal security of the EU. 
The ARA conclusions and identified risks at 
the EU’s external borders are meant to help 
effectively balance and prioritise the alloca-
tion of resources.
Frontex operational activities aim to 
strengthen border security by ensuring the 
coordination of Member States’ actions in 
the implementation of Community measures 
relating to the management of the external 
borders. The coordination of operational ac-
tivities also contributes to better allocation 
of Member States’ resources and protection 
of the area of freedom, security and justice.
The ARA 2013 concentrates on the current 
scope of Frontex operational activities, which 
focus on irregular migration at the exter-
nal borders of the EU and the Schengen As-
sociated Countries. Central to the concept 
of integrated border management (IBM), 
border management should also cover se-
curity threats present at the external bor-
ders. Hence, a full section is devoted to the 
phenomenon of trafficking in human beings 
(THB), the combating of which was tasked 
to Frontex pursuant to the EU action plan 
(2005/C 311/01) on best practices, standards 
and procedures for combating and prevent-
ing THB.
The Frontex Risk Analysis Unit (RAU) would 
like to express its gratitude to all members 
of the Frontex Risk Analysis Network (FRAN) 
in Member States for their efforts in provid-
ing data and information, as well as Europol, 
EASO and the European Commission, which 
have contributed to the ARA 2013, and all 
Frontex colleagues involved in the prepara-
tion of this report.
1. Introduction
8 of 80
2.1. Data exchange
A coherent and full analysis of the risks affect-
ing security at the external borders requires, 
above all, the adoption of common indica-
tors. Consistent monitoring of these indica-
tors will then allow effective measures to be 
taken on the ground. The analysis will need 
to identify the risks that arise at the exter-
nal borders themselves and those that arise 
in third countries. 
The backbone of the ARA 2013 is the monthly 
statistics exchanged between Member States 
within the framework of the Frontex Risk 
Analysis Network (FRAN). This regular data-
exchange exercise was launched in September 
2007 and then refined in 2008. Thanks to the 
FRAN members’ efforts, a much larger statis-
tical coverage was achieved in 2011, focusing 
on seven key indicators of irregular migration: 
(1) detections of illegal border-crossing, (2) re-
fusals of entry, (3) detections of illegal stay, 
(4) asylum applications, (5) detections of fa-
cilitators, (6) detections of forged documents 
and (7) return decisions and effective returns.
Following the closing of the CIREFI working 
group in April 2010, most of its mandate, in 
particular those concerning the exchange of 
data, were transferred to the FRAN. Most 
indicators monitored by CIREFI had already 
been part of the monthly data exchange 
among FRAN members and only the statis-
tics on returns had to be added as the sev-
enth indicator of the regular data exchange 
as of January 2011.
In 2011, the original FRAN indicator on forged 
documents was updated to enable the anal-
ysis of complex modi operandi. Following a 
successful pilot study, the European Un-
ion Document-Fraud Risk Analysis Net-
work (EDF-RAN) was formed in early 2012 
to oversee the exchange of a much more 
comprehensive and detailed indicator on doc-
ument fraud, including the abuse of genuine 
documents.
Member States were not requested to an-
swer specific questions in support of this 
analysis. Rather, bi-monthly analytical re-
ports and incident reports of Member States 
routinely collected within the FRAN and 
Member States’ contributions to several Tai-
lored Risk Analyses produced in 2012 were 
both important sources of information, es-
pecially as regards the analysis of routes and 
modi operandi.
Open-source information was also effectively 
exploited, especially in identifying the main 
push and pull factors for irregular migration to 
the EU. Among others, these sources included 
reports issued by government agencies, in-
ternational and non-governmental organisa-
tions, as well as official EU reports, such as 
the European Commission’s reports on third 
countries, and mainstream news agencies.
The data exchanged within the FRAN are 
compiled and analysed on a quarterly ba-
sis. Priority is given to the use of the data for 
management purposes and to its fast sharing

2. Methodology
among Member State border-control author-
ities. Member States’ data that are processed 
by Frontex are not treated as official statistics, 
and thus may occasionally vary from the data 
officially published by national authorities.
Throughout 2012, some FRAN Members per-
formed backdated updates of their 2011 statis-
tics. These updates have been accounted for 
in this document and so some data presented 
here may differ from the data presented a 
year ago in the 2012 Annual Risk Analysis.
External borders refer to the borders be-
tween Member States and third countries. 
The borders between the Schengen Associ-
ated Countries (Norway, Iceland and Switzer-
land) and third countries are also considered 
as external borders. The borders between the 
Schengen Associated Countries and Schen-
gen Member States are considered as inter-
nal borders. For the indicators on detections 
of facilitators, illegal stay and asylum, statis-
tics are also reported for detections at the 
land borders between the Schengen Mem-
ber States and Schengen candidates (Bulgaria, 
Romania) or non-Schengen Member States 
(the UK, Ireland), so that a total for Member 
States and the Schengen Associated Coun-
tries as a whole can be presented. It was not 
possible to make this distinction for air and 
sea borders because Member States do not 
habitually differentiate between extra-EU and 
intra-EU air and sea connections but tend 
to aggregate data for all arrivals per airport.
In turn, Europol contributed to the ARA 2013 
by providing information on facilitated irreg-
ular migration. EASO also contributed to the 
section on asylum applications.
2.2. Quality of available data
Consistent with other law-enforcement in-
dicators, variation in administrative data re-
lated to border control depends on several 
factors. In this case, the number of detections 
of illegal border-crossing and refusals of en-
try are both functions of the amount of ef-
fort spent detecting migrants and the actual 
flow of irregular migrants to the EU. For ex-
ample, increased detections of illegal border-
crossing might be due to a real increase in the 
flow of irregular migrants, or may in fact be 
an outcome of more resources made availa-
ble to detect migrants. In exceptional cases, 
increased resources may produce a rise in re-
ported detections while effectively masking 
the actual decrease in the flow of migrants, 
resulting from a strong deterrent effect.
Conservative estimates of the number of ir-
regular migrants within the EU vary between 
three and six million, according to the results 
of Clandestino, an EU-sponsored project im-
plemented by the ICMPD. Other estimates 
put the figure of irregular migrants at eight 
million, of which 80% are staying inside the 
Schengen area, half of them having originally 
entered it legally. However, there is currently 
no estimate of the annual flow of irregular 
migrants crossing the border illegally.
Information on national-level resources for 
border-control authorities and their alloca-
tion is currently only partially known. These 
data are provided by Member States them-
selves either within the Schengen evaluation 
mechanism or within the External Borders 
Fund reporting. Without systematic and re-
liable information on resources allocated to 
border control and without estimates of ir-
regular migration flows, it is not possible to 
assess the performance and impact of the 
border controls put in place, and the analy-
ses of the situation at the EU’s external bor-
ders are limited to descriptive statistics of 
the administrative data provided by Mem-
ber States.
As highlighted in the Schengen Catalogue, 
variation in regular passenger flow is an im-
portant factor to be taken into account in the 
allocation of border-control resources. How-
Frontex · annual risk analysis 2013 
10 of 80
11 of 80
ever, regular flows of passengers across the 
EU’s external borders are currently not re-
corded systematically.
Data on the number of EU visas issued and 
their places of issue would improve the char-
acterisation of third-country passenger flows. 
However, this information, which is collected 
within the Council Visa Working Party and 
published by the European Commission, is 
not yet available for 2012. For the purpose 
of the ARA, data from 2008 to 2011 are dis-
cussed as an introduction to the general sit-
uation at the borders.
2.3. Application of the Common 
Integrated Risk Analysis Model 
(CIRAM)
A key development in the CIRAM 2.0 up-
date released in 2011 was the adoption of a 
management approach to risk analysis that 
defines risk as a function of the threat, vul-
nerability and impact. Such an approach en-
deavours to reflect the spirit of the Schengen 
Borders Code and the Frontex Regulation, 
both of which emphasise risk analysis as a 
key tool in ensuring the optimal allocation of 
resources within constraints of budget, staff 
and efficiency of equipment.
According to the model, a ‘threat’ is a force 
or pressure acting upon the external borders 
that is characterised by both its magnitude 
and likelihood; ‘vulnerability’ is defined as the 
capacity of a system to mitigate the threat 
and ‘impact’ is determined as the potential 
consequences of the threat. In this way, the 
structured and systematic breakdown of risk 
presented as conclusion provides for an as-
sessment of the relative overall risks posed by 
different threats as a function of the relevant 
vulnerabilities and impact, and therefore will 
be of much use to decision-makers in setting 
priorities, in formulating counter-measures 
and designating operational targets.

3.1. Passenger flow across the 
EU’s external borders 
Passenger flow is an indicator of the volume 
of checks that border guards have to perform, 
relative to the number of border guards. Cit-
izens enjoying free movement are subject to 
minimum checks, while third-country nation-
als, whether they require visas or not, are sub-
ject to more thorough checks, as defined by 
the Schengen Borders Code. Hence, the na-
ture and extent of passenger flow determine 
to a large extent the planning and allocation 
of resources for border checks.
Passenger flow data also prove useful in an-
alysing indicators of irregular migration, in 
particular refusals of entry and detections 
of document fraud. Indeed, differences in the 
rates of refusal of entry over passenger flow 
may help identify best practice and eventu-
ally ensure that checks are performed in a 
harmonised way across the BCPs of the EU. 
Similarly, detections of document fraud are 
most effectively analysed in connection with 
passenger flows and detection rates, rather 
than the number of detections, and provide 
the most useful tool for assessing border 
checks and flows of document fraudsters.
At European level there is no systematic re-
porting on passenger flows by BCP, border 
section or as a total for the EU’s external bor-
der. Member States reported data on passen-
ger flow in the framework of the European 
Borders Fund (EBF), but this excludes the 
UK and Ireland, which do not participate in 
the EBF, and including crossings between 
non-Schengen and Schengen Member States 
(France-UK, Belgium-UK, Romania-Hungary). 
The total at the air border represents all pas-
senger flows, including passengers from EU 
countries. The EBF total for sea border cross-
ing probably also includes crossings between 
Member States. Given these uncertainties, 
it is difficult to estimate the EU total pas-
senger flow from third countries that could 
usefully be analysed against the number of 
refusals of entry and detections of fraudu-
lent documents. 
Air borders
Eurostat provides data on air passenger flow 
(EU nationals and third-country nationals) 
coming only from third countries, which to-
talled 125 million in 2011, including the UK and 
Ireland. At the air borders, estimates derived 
from Eurostat data released in January 2013, 
show a steady trend of + 1% in arrivals from 
third countries between 2010 and 2011, at a 
total of about 125 million arrivals from outside 
the EU in 2011. The UK, Germany and France 
ranked amongst the first, with more than 20 
million arrivals from third countries. Italy and 
the Netherlands follow at a distance with less 
than 10 million arrivals from third countries. 
The largest numbers of arrivals are reported 
from the airport of London Heathrow with

3. Situational picture in 2012
approximately 17 million passengers, followed 
by Paris-Charles De Gaulle airport (13 million) 
and Frankfurt airport (11 million). At Frank-
furt airport, as at many airports in the EU, 
the top priority is now on reducing the time 
for check-in, security and passport control. 
Land borders
At the external land borders of the EU, al-
though there is no systematic collection of 
passenger flow data at EU level, the busiest 
border section for entries of passengers is 
probably the border between Slovenia and 
Croatia, with approximately 23 million annual 
entries. The land border between Spain and 
Morocco is also a very busy border section, 
totalling more than 10 million annual entries 
(for both Ceuta and Melilla). The land border 
between Poland and Ukraine, with approxi-
mately seven million passengers annually, also 
belongs to the busiest land border sections.
Along the eastern land border, stretching for 
more than 4 000 km from Romania to Fin-
land, one recurring pattern is the strong sea-
sonality of regular passenger flows, with most 
of the crossings (entry/exit) taking place dur-
ing the summer months. This requires an op-
timal mobilisation of resources during this 
period to avoid undue waiting time for bona 
fide travellers. 
Passenger flows are widely expected to in-
crease at the land borders in the coming 
years, in particular along the main BCPs at 
the land borders with the Russian Federa-
tion, Ukraine and Turkey. While all BCPs are 
equipped to meet the standards required 
by the Schengen Borders Code, differences 
in the nature of the flow of passengers and 
commercial traffic explains the differences in 
staffing levels between BCPs. A study* per-
formed by the Center for the Study of De-
mocracy, based on Member States answers 
for 2009, shows that there can be important 
differences in the characteristics of BCPs.
3.2. Visa
Visa policy acts as a form of pre-entry pro-
cedure to ensure that third-country nation-
als comply with entry requirements, which 
helps to prevent irregular migration. In this 
respect, particularly important in prevent-
ing subsequent illegal staying is the role of 
consular offices in third countries deter-
mining whether a third-country national 
should be granted a visa or not. Member 
States have introduced a variety of specific 
measures in their visa-issuing procedures to 
tackle irregular migration, which includes 
the assessment of willingness to return, the 
training of personnel at embassies and con-
sulates, and cooperation and information 
exchange with other entities and Member 
States. Other preventive measures include 
the use of biometric data in the visa appli-
cation process, as well as the identification 
of specific categories of migrants who might 
misuse their visa and awareness raising in 
third countries of the consequences of mak-
ing fraudulent applications.** 
The Community Code on Visas, which en-
tered into force in April 2010, sets out the 
common requirements for issuing transit 
and short-term visas to enter the terri-
tory of Member States. There are cur-
rently over 100 nationalities that require 
a visa to enter the EU, covering more than 
80% of non-EU population of the world. 
Nevertheless, about one billion nation-
als from approximately 40 third countries 
do not require an EU visa. These include 
Australia, Canada, Croatia, Japan, New 
Zealand and the USA. The list of coun-
tries whose nationals require a visa to 
travel to the UK or Ireland differs slightly 
from other EU countries. As indicated in 
the Visa Code, statistical data are an im-
portant means of monitoring migratory 
movements and can serve as an eff icient 
management tool.

Recent changes to Schengen regulations 
have seen a simplification of the visa re-
gime. Schengen Member States now issue 
only three types of visa: (1) airport tran-
sit visa (A) – valid only for airport transit, 
does not entitle the holder to leave the 
transit zone of the airport; (2) short-stay 
visa (C); (3) national long-stay visas (D) 
and residence permits. Generally, a short-
stay visa issued by one of the Schengen 
States (visa C) entitles its holder to travel 
throughout the 26 Schengen States for up 
to three months within a six-month pe-
riod. Visas for visits exceeding that period 
remain subject to national procedures. The 
data include visas issued by the Schen-
gen Associated Countries (Iceland, Nor-
way, Switzerland), as well as by Romania 
and Bulgaria, which have not yet joined 
the Schengen area, and exclude visa data 
in the UK and Ireland, which are not part 
of the Schengen area.

Data for 2012 are not yet available, but the 
European Commission, through its DG Home 
Affairs has released the data for 2011. VIS 
data are collected on the basis of the place 
where the application is made, and not on 
the citizenship of the visa applicant. Thus, for 
instance, applications made in the Russian 
Federation do not necessarily concern only 
Russian nationals. However, in the following 
overview, the country where the visas were 
delivered was used as the most suitable ap-
proximation of the visas issued to citizens of 
that country. Visas broken down by national-
ities are available at the national level, where 
they can be used for operational purposes.
In 2011 more than 13.8 million visas (all 
types) were issued by Schengen and non-
Schengen Member States (including Bul-
garia and Romania, but excluding the UK 
and Ireland). The vast majority of visas is-
sued were category C, or short-stay visas, 
accounting for 98% of all visas issued, fol-
lowed by long-stay visas (2%) and airport 
transit (A) visas (0.1%).
The annual increase of 4% between 2010 and 
2011 increased the number of visas to a level 
similar to that of 2007, i.e. before the eco-
nomic crisis hit the EU and significantly re-
duced the number of visitors.

Consistent with every year since 2007, in 
2011 the Russian Federation was where most 
short-term visas were issued (5 556 941) rep-
resenting a 24% increase compared to the 
previous year. Visas issued in the top three 
countries account for 58% of all short-stay 
visas issued in 2011. Figure 3 illustrates the 
number of visas issued in 2010 and 2011 for 
the top five third countries in 2011 (circle 
size) and the degree of change (slopes) be-
tween the years.
This significant increase in the number of vi-
sas issued in the Russian Federation is simi-
lar to the increase of 28% observed between 
2009 and 2010. In total, short-term visas is-
sued in the Russian Federation accounted for 
41% of all category C visas issued by Member 
States in 2011. Ukraine followed with 1 270 157 
visas issued in 2011 marking an increase of 
20% compared to 2010. As in 2010, China, 
ranked third with 1 031 866, saw the most 
significant increase in the number of visas 
issued from 2010 to 2011, i.e. by 31% and so it 
is shown at the top of Figure 3.
Most short-term visas were issued by France 
(1 938 556 visas issued, or 14% of all short-
term visas issued), followed by a group of four 
Member States (Germany, Italy, Spain and 
Finland) that all issued more than 1 million vi-
sas. Together, these five Member States ac-
counted for 56% of all issued short-stay visas. 
Table 3 (overleaf) shows the numbers of vi-
sas issued by the top ten Member States in 
specific third countries. This table clearly il-
lustrates the large increase in the number of 
visas issued in the Russian Federation by sev-
eral Member States. Spain reported the largest 
increase (+52%), and in most Member States, 
the number of visas delivered in the Russian 
Federation represented a double digit increase.

Overstaying the legal visa period
There are no data available on the rate of 
people who arrive on short-term visas but 
do no depart before their visa expires (over-
staying). However, experiences from coun-
tries implementing entry-exit systems, like 
Australia or Thailand, showed that such in-
dicator can be useful for decision-makers 
when assessing visa applications. Indeed, 
it is generally believed that overstaying is 
a very common modus operandi for irregu-
lar migration to the EU. 
Visa refusals
The consulate competent for dealing with 
visa applications assesses: 
1.  whether the applicant fulfils the entry 
conditions;
2. the risk of irregular immigration;
3.  the applicant’s intention to leave the ter-
ritory of the Member State before the ex-
piry of the visa;
4.  whether the applicant presents a risk to 
the security or public health of the Mem-
ber State. 
As a result, some visa applications are re-
fused. There are no data on the reasons for 
refusals of visa applications, but the overall 
refusal rate for visa applications may be de-
termined per third country where visas are 
issued. Combined with additional informa-
tion and tailored to operational needs, the 
rate of refusals of visa in consulates may be 
used by border-control authorities to deter-

In 2011, about 6% of the 14 373 334 visa appli-

32% for applications made in West Africa, and 
to 20% in the Caribbean. Visa refusal rates 
varied widely between Member States, from 
17% of 242 857 applications in Belgium to 1% 
of 1 259 643 applications in Finland. 
UK visas
In 2011 for the UK alone, data on entry clear-
ance visas and admissions of those who are 
subject to immigration control coming to the 
UK for study, work and family reasons show 
that: student immigration has seen a general 
increase since 2005, rising particularly rap-
idly in 2009; work-related immigration has 
fallen overall since 2006; and family immigra-
tion has shown a slow overall decrease since 
2006. The latest visa data for 2011 indicate 
the number of student visas has fallen since 
a peak in the year ending June 2010 and work 
visas have continued to fall after a slight in-
crease in the year ending March 2011. Visas 
for family reasons also fell.
Excluding visitor and transit visas, 6% fewer 
visas were issued in 2011 (564 000) than in 
2010 (597 000). However, there were a re-
cord 1.7 million visitor visas issued in 2011, 11% 
more than a year earlier (1.5 million).*
In total, the UK issued 2 272 891 visas, with 
a refusal rate of 12%. The UK Border Agency 
(UKBA) published extensive statistics on vi-
sas issued, including breakdown by nation-
alities, but also by categories of visa (work, 
student, family, other) and categories of spon-
sors, broken down by nationalities and places 
of delivery.
Resident permits
An EMN note released in September 2012** 
showed that more than 1.93 million first resi-
dence permits were issued in 2011, an increase 
of 15% compared to 2010. This total excludes 
Belgium, Cyprus and Poland, which amounted 
to some 188 400 residence permits in 2010. 
Most residence permits were issued by Italy 
(331 000) and France (193 400). 
At EU level, the Single Permit Directive was 
adopted in December 2011. The new legis-
lation provides for a single application pro-
cedure for a single permit for third-country 
nationals to reside and work on the territory 
of a Member State. Negotiations continued 
on the proposals for directives on the condi-
tions of entry and residence of third-country 
nationals for the purpose of seasonal em-
ployment and on conditions of entry and 
residence of third-country nationals in the 
framework of an intra-corporate transfer. 
Infringement procedures for non-communi-
cation of national measures transposing the 
EU Blue Card Directive*** were launched in 
2011 in respect of six Member States. In 2012, 
a second set of infringement procedures were 
launched in respect of five Member States.
3.3. Illegal border-crossing
Detections of illegal border-crossing along 
the EU’s external borders sharply dropped 
in 2012 to 72 437 detections, a 49% decrease 
compared to 2011 due mainly to the com-
bined effects of enhanced surveillance at 
the land border between Greece and Turkey, 
where detections decreased by 44%, and to 
a sharp drop in the Central Mediterranean, 
where detections fell from 59 000 in 2011, 
mostly in connection to the Arab Spring, to 
10 379 in 2012 (-82%). 
In the first half of 2012, detections in the Cen-
tral Mediterranean area were much reduced

Migration and Mobility 
in 2011, 2012
compared to the peak period of February–
September 2011 that registered most of the 
departures connected to people leaving Tuni-
sia and Libya. Most detections of illegal bor-
der-crossing along the external borders were 
on the South-Eastern border of the EU. The 
situation changed drastically in August 2012 
when the Greek authorities mobilised unprec-
edented resources at their land border with 
Turkey, including the deployment of 1 800 ad-
ditional Greek Police Officers. Detections of 
illegal border-crossing rapidly dropped from 
about 2 000 in the first week of August to 
less than 10 per week in October 2012. 
Looking at nationalities, despite an over 43% 
reduction compared to 2011, at 13 169 detec-
tions, Afghans still accounted for 18% of all de-
tections of illegal border-crossing at EU level. 
The majority of these Afghan migrants was 
detected at the land border between Greece 
and Turkey, where detections fell after August 
2012. Afghans continued to be detected mak-
ing secondary movement across the Hungar-
ian land border with Serbia. 
In 2012, the nationality with the most dra-
matic change in the number of detections 
were Syrians, both in terms of relative growth 
and absolute number, from 1 616 in 2011 to 
7 903 in 2012 (+389%). A large majority of all 
detected Syrian migrants were reported from 
the Greek land border with Turkey. Migrants 
from Eritrea (5 038 detections in 2012, +67%) 
and Somalia (2 604, +66%) were increasingly 
detected in the Central Mediterranean route. 
3.3.1. Routes
In the annual total for 2012, detections of ille-
gal border-crossing on the Eastern Mediter-
ranean route still accounted for the largest 
percentage of all detections (37 214, 51% of 
2012 total). Many migrants who crossed 
the border illegally to Greece continue to 
other Member States, either through the 
land route across the Western Balkans, or 
through ferry links to Italy or by air to other 
Schengen Member States. 
Throughout 2012, detections in the Central 
Mediterranean region steadily increased to 
reach an annual total of 10 379 (14% of the to-
tal). Most migrants were from sub-Saharan 
countries and departed from Libya. 
In the Western Mediterranean area, at the 
land and sea borders between northern Africa 
and Spain, detections of illegal border-cross-
ing totalled 6 397, representing a 24% decrease 
compared to 2011. This level is comparable to 
the detections reported in 2008 and 2010. 
Most migrants were Algerians or sub-Saha-
rans departing from Morocco and Algeria. 
In March 2012, Belarusian authorities ap-
peared to relax their border surveillance, 
resulting in increased detections of illegal 
border-crossing in Lithuania and Poland. 
Compared to 2011, detections increased by 
52% along the eastern land border, totalling 
nearly 1 600. However, as was the case in 
previous years, this total represented only a 
small fraction of all detections in the EU (2%).

n	Eastern Mediterranean route
Since data collection began in early 2008, 
the Eastern Mediterranean has maintained 
its status as a hotspot of irregular migration. 
Detections have followed a remarkably sea-
sonal pattern invariably peaking in the third 
quarter of each year and concentrated at the 
border between Greece and Turkey. How-
ever, following the implementation of a set 
of Greek operations in August 2012 as well 
as the continued implementation of Fron-
tex-coordinated JOs (Aeneas, Hermes and 
Poseidon Sea), by the end of the year, detec-
tions dropped off to almost negligible levels. 
The operation Xenios Zeus focuses on inland 
detections of illegal stay in Greece and their 
subsequent return, while the operation As-
pida enhances the surveillance on the Greek-
Turkish land border.
The operational activities included:

Detections of illegal border-crossing
Sources: FRAN data as of 12 February 2013
Figure 5. Detections of illegal border-crossing along the EU’s external borders plunged

nical assets at the Greek-Turkish land 
border aimed at increasing surveillance 
and response capacity to tackle illegal 
border-crossing; 
(b)  creation of significant additional capacity 
for hosting irregular migrants in deten-
tion centres in order to be able to facili-
tate identification and return; 
(c)  use of new tactics for border surveillance 
and improved cooperation with the Turk-
ish authorities at the border; 
(d)  reduction in the time period for which ir-
regular migrants have to leave Greece if 
not held in detention centres from 30 to 
7 days; and 
(e)  inland activities for the detection of irreg-
ular migrants on Greek territory.
As a result, from 6 August 2012 onwards 
the number of apprehensions significantly 
dropped at the Greek-Turkish land border. 
The operations produced a slight shift to 
the Bulgarian land border and the sea bor-
der with Turkey. Italy reported a few detec-
tions of migrants attempting to cross directly 
from Turkey, and at EU level, Member States 
also reported a small increase in detections 
of migrants with fraudulent documents on 
flights departing from Istanbul. However, 
these increases in detections on alternative 
route to the land border between Turkey 
and Greece, do not match previous levels, as 
seen in Figure 6. 
The operations were initially planned for a 
three month period, but were then renewed 
in October 2012 for another three month pe-
riod. In January 2013, the Greek authorities 
announced the 3rd phase of the operation 
Aspida, which will run until 3 April 2013 with 
1 100 police officers deployed in Evros region.
Partial shift to sea borders
Detections in the Aegean Sea, between 
Turkey and Greece, increased by 912%. This 
increasing trend started after September 
2012, as migrants considered sea crossing as 
an alternative to the land route to Greece. 
It is indeed at the sea borders where the 
most significant shift in detections of ille-
gal border-crossing was reported. The in-
crease started immediately following the 
enhanced surveillance at the land border.

Worryingly, detections were still relatively 
large at the end of year, despite the winter 
conditions that makes sea crossing more 
treacherous. This may signal a resurgence 
of the pressure in the Aegean Sea after 
three years of relatively low detections. 
Indeed, in 2009, the Aegean Sea was the 
main area for detections of illegal border-
crossing into the EU. 
Migrants detected in the Aegean Sea were 
mainly apprehended inland after their arrival 
from the western coast of Turkey, while a 
small number of migrants were apprehended 
directly at sea trying to reach the Greek Ae-
gean Islands. The most targeted islands were 
Lesbos, Samos, Agathonisi, Farmakonisi and 
Symi. Most migrants had departed from Izmir 
on the Western Turkish coast. 
The Turkish authorities have also stepped up 
their surveillance efforts, with the Turkish 
Coast Guards intercepting migrants in rub-
ber boats and vessels before they reach the 
Greek territorial waters. 
In the Ionian Sea, there was no signifi-
cant increase after August 2012. Most of 
the migrants detected in the Ionian Sea 
had departed from Greece, after having 
crossed the border illegally between Tur-
key and Greece. 
Partial shift to the land border between 
Bulgaria and Turkey
Since systematic data collection began in 
early 2008, detections of illegal border-cross-
ing at the Bulgarian-Turkish land border were 
rather low. The situation changed in 2012, 
when a total of around four times as many 
migrants were apprehended. This increase 
is connected to the strengthening of bor-
der control at the Greek-Turkish land border, 
where most migrants used to cross illegally 
into the EU, in August 2012. 
The main nationalities apprehended in Bul-
garia during 2012 were Syrians, Palestinians, 
Iraqis, Algerians and Malians. Up until Au-
gust there were very few sub-Saharan mi-
grants detected at the Bulgarian-Turkish land 
border; however, from the beginning of the 
Greek operation Aspida until end of Decem-
ber 2012, their number rose to represent 16% 
of all detections. Most sub-Saharan migrants 
had arrived legally in Turkey by air (most of 
them either do not need visa or can easily 
obtain it on arrival in Turkey).
Following this increase, the Bulgarian au-
thorities quickly reacted in October 2012 by 
setting-up a Specialised Police Operation at 
the Bulgarian-Turkish land border in the ar-
eas of the Border Police Units of Svilengrad 
and Elhovo, deploying additional officers, pa-
trol cars and service dogs along the Bulgar-
ian-Turkish border. Measures have also been 
taken to enhance air surveillance. 
These actions complement the efforts of the 
Bulgarian authorities to implement an In-
tegrated Border Surveillance System at the 
border section between the BCP Kapitan An-
dreevo and Lesovo. The system covers 58 km 
of the most affected section of the Bulgar-
ian-Turkish land border. The Bulgarian au-
thorities are planning to extend the system 
to cover the entire border section. 
Staying in Turkey
Given the rather limited shift in detections 
of migrants crossing illegally from Turkey, it 
is also likely that a substantial proportion of 
migrants failing or not trying to enter the EU 
prefer to stay in Turkey, rather than return-
ing to their more unstable and substantially 
poorer home countries. Although lacking res-
idency status, and, therefore, vulnerable to 
exploitation, they may find jobs in specific 
niches in the Turkish informal sector, tour-
ism, petty trade, construction and agriculture.

Nationalities on the Eastern 
Mediterranean route
There was some variation in the extent to 
which detections of different nationalities 
decreased in response to the operations. 
However, the deterring effect was the least 
pronounced in the case of Syrians as the de-
tections of this nationality were the last to 
decrease and the scale of their decline was 
the smallest. In the second half of 2012, Syr-
ians were by far the most detected nation-
ality in this area.
Although not reflected in the analysis of the 
top nationalities, the number of Algerians 
detected crossing illegally the border on the 
Eastern Mediterranean route in 2012 (2 223 
detections) was larger than the number of 
Algerians detected on the Western Mediter-
ranean route (2 015 detections), which is their 
traditional route with direct departure from 
the Algerian coast. This shift is explained by 
cheap flight connections from Algeria to Tur-
key and the easiness to obtain Turkish visa. 
Afghan migrants
Some reports state that in Iran there are cur-
rently 2–4 million displaced Afghans who have 
been residing there for several years. How-
ever, an agreement of the Iranian govern-
ment to provide Afghans with documents to 
legalise their stay and provide permission to 
work has recently expired, rendering many 
Afghan nationals as illegal stayers in Iran. 
Hence, many now-irregular migrants in this 
situation are coming to the EU. 
Pakistani migrants
Most migrants coming to the EU from Pa-
kistan via the Greek-Turkish border, are sin-
gle, male adults between the ages of 21 and 
29, non-skilled Urdu-speaking workers and 
students. When illegally crossing the exter-
nal border they tend to travel undocumented. 
The passports are often withheld by facilita-
tors in Turkey with the assurance that they 
will be sent to other facilitators in Greece. 
The most frequent place of origin is the north-
ern part of the Punjab province. According to 
the statements provided in interviews, the 
destination countries are Greece, Italy and 
Spain, but considering the number of returned 
Pakistani nationals, the UK could be the main 
final destination country. The main Member 
States reporting the effective return of Paki-
stanis were the UK and Greece.
The main reason why Pakistanis choose to 
migrate to the EU is economic, because of a 
lack of employment opportunities and very 
low salaries in Pakistan. 
Bangladeshi migrants
Most of the Bangladeshi migrants interviewed 
after having illegally crossed the Greek-Turk-
ish land border claimed that they had de-
parted from countries around the Persian

Gulf, where they had been legally working in 
the construction business. Following the eco-
nomic crisis in the area, salaries fell and fewer 
jobs were available; consequently, many mi-
grants decided to try to reach the EU in search 
of better employment opportunities. It was 
established that facilitators working in the 
Gulf area deceptively assured the migrants 
that there were plenty of good jobs and high 
salaries in Greece. 
The Bangladeshi migrants travelled by car 
to Oman, from where they crossed the Gulf 
of Oman to Iran in fast speedboats. From 
Bandar-E-Abbas they travelled on buses 
and in vans to Teheran, where they joined 
the flow of mostly Afghan and Pakistani 
migrants arriving from the east. From Te-
heran, the migrants were transported to 
Urmia and then crossed the Iranian-Turk-
ish border in large groups of up to 1 000 
migrants, and headed towards Van. In Van, 
migrants received false Turkish documents 
and used a regular bus connection to get 
to Istanbul. From there, facilitators trans-
ported them to the River Evros, or alter-
native routes.
Syrian migrants
While the increasing number of detections 
of illegal border-crossing is generally linked 
to the internal situation in Syria, the prevail-
ing profile of Syrians detected at the Greek-
Turkish border remains somewhat different 
to the refugee flow from Syria into Turkey. 
Also, roughly 15% of Syrians detected at the 
Greek-Turkish border during 2012 were in fact 
not native to Syria. These false claims of na-
tionality often occur in conjunction with new 
or emerging crises and are linked to nation-
alities with common linguistic and/or geo-
graphical origin. In this case, migrants falsely 
claiming Syrian nationality were mostly Iraqis 
and, to a lesser extent, also Egyptians, Mo-
roccans, Libyans and Tunisians. 
Syrians detected crossing the border illegally 
in Greece were predominantly male (74%), 
while the UNHCR data for the refugee flow 
into the neighbouring countries suggest that 
75% were women and children. While there 
were also family units detected, the major-
ity of Syrians arriving in Greece were youths 
aged between 20 and 28.
The main areas of departure from Syria were 
the north-west around the city of Aleppo, the 
north-east around the city of Al Qamishli and 
the capital Damascus. Migrants tended to 
use cars and buses for legal entry to Turkey. 
With the help of Syrian facilitators some also 
enter Turkey illegally on foot, although this 
is an exception. Importantly, while on route 
to Greece, Syrians do not usually seek inter-
national protection in Turkey.

Figure 8. Most migrants from Bangladesh detected during 
JO Poseidon Land travelled overland from the Gulf States
Some Syrians departing from Damascus 
tended to travel legally to Beirut, fly to Is-
tanbul and from there continue their jour-
ney to Greece with the help of the facilitators. 
While staying in Istanbul, Syrians made con-
tact with facilitators.
A German court ruled early in 2012 that Syr-
ian nationals applying for international pro-
tection are to be granted automatic refugee 
status on the grounds that the very act of 
leaving Syria presumably illegally, and then 
asking for international protection may, upon 
return to Syria, result in torture and impris-
onment. Sweden also declared that Syrian 
nationals claiming for asylum would also 
be automatically granted protection, while 
other Member States are reviewing their 
policies.
Secondary movements
Greece is a Schengen exclave and a tran-
sit rather than destination country for the 
majority of migrants. Thus, the secondary 
movements originating in Greece are char-
acterised by a similar composition of nation-
alities of migrants attempting to re-enter the 
Schengen area heading for their final desti-
nations as those who enter Greece. In 2012, 
these movements tended to be reflected in 
the detections of: 
1)  illegal border-crossing throughout the 
Western Balkan land borders; 
2)  migrants landing at the blue border of 
the southern Italian regions of Apulia and 
Calabria; 
3)  clandestines and document fraudsters on 
board ferries to Italy (Ancona, Venice);
4)  document fraudsters travelling on flights 
from Greek airports to many major EU 
airports.
Illegal border-crossing throughout the 
Western Balkan land borders: There were 
almost 35 000 detections of illegal border-
crossing between BCPs reported at borders 
between Western Balkan countries them-
selves or at their borders with the neigh-
bouring Member States. The number was 
one third higher compared to 2011. Among 
the top five border sections, Croatia-Slove-
nia reported the highest increases (+95%) 
between 2011 and 2012. Afghans continued 
to dominate the nationalities ranking with 
a 23% share of the total. Their numbers rose 
by almost 10% to 8 065, however, the high-
est relative increases between 2011 and 2012 
were reported by Syrians (+1 689%), Somalis 
(+223%) and Algerians.
Worth mentioning is also the fact that many 
more migrants opted for clandestine entry 
(hiding in lorries or trains) during 2012 com-
pared to 2011. In fact, Western Balkan coun-
tries and the neighbouring Member States 
detected almost 1 676 or 87% more persons 
hiding in vehicles while trying to cross bor-
ders illegally. The top border section was Ser-
bia-former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, 
where authorities on both sides of the bor-
der detected 25% more than during 2011. As 
in the case for green border crossings, Af-
ghans were the top nationality with a 45% 
share of the total.
Migrants landing at the blue border of 
the southern Italian regions of Apulia and 
Calabria: In 2012, there was a steady flow of 
Afghans and, to a lesser extent, Pakistanis ar-
riving in the southern Italian blue borders of 
Calabria and Apulia with some very large in-
creases during the third quarter of 2012. The 
most commonly detected migrants were 
from Afghanistan, representing a steady share 
of about 30%. Detections of migrants from 
Pakistan, Bangladesh and Syria increased very 
sharply since the beginning of 2012.
Many migrants indicated that they had ini-
tially entered the Schengen area by crossing 
the land border between Greece and Turkey. 
In 2011, it was estimated that more than 15% 
of migrants reported at the Greek–Turkish 
27 of 80
land border were afterwards detected in 
Apulia and Calabria. 
Increasing numbers of other migrants, usu-
ally from Asia, claim to have been living in 
Greece for a number of years before decid-
ing to leave for other Member States be-
cause of the economic crisis. Some of the 
migrants stated that they had been work-
ing in agriculture jobs for EUR 25–30 per 
day, but many did not receive any salary for 
a certain period which prompted their de-
cision to leave.
Document fraudsters travelling on flights 
from Greek airports to many major EU air-
ports: In 2012, there were more than 500 
detections of migrants travelling on intra-
Schengen flights with fraudulent documents. 
These intra-Schengen document fraudsters 
were mostly detected by Italy (entry and 
exit) and Greece (exit), where numbers were 
increasing throughout 2012 and, to a lesser 
extent, by Germany (entry), where numbers 
were decreasing.
Following recent increases, Syrians were 
the most detected nationality on intra-
Schengen flights followed by Afghans and 
Somalis.
n	Central Mediterranean route
In the Central Mediterranean area, the large 
and suddenly increased number of detec-
tions in 2011, following the turmoil in Tunisia 
and Libya, had been significantly reduced 
by the end of 2011. However, throughout 
2012, detections steadily increased and by 
the end of the year they totalled more than 
10  000 detections. Most migrants were 
from sub-Saharan countries (particularly 
Eritrea and Somalia) and departed from 
Libya.
The institutional capacity to tackle irregular 
migration in North Africa remains limited. 
Libya is of the biggest concern in this respect 
given its fractured, with four regions declared 
military zones, non-consolidated and difficult-
to-govern emerging institutional framework. 
The country is still plagued with frequent kill-
ings and kidnappings. 
In the Central Mediterranean area, mi-
grants illegally crossing the borders to the 
EU used a wide variety of boats, ranging 
from small rubber dinghies up to medium-
size wooden fishing boats. Fishing boats 
departing from Libya were more difficult 
to find after the wake of departures during

the ‘Arab Spring’, and are often overloaded. 
Rubber boats, the cheapest alternative to 
the wooden fishing boats, are prone to 
capsizing in high-sea conditions and have 
often been equipped with poor engines, 
two factors contributing to increasingly 
put migrant lives at risk. From Tunisia, mi-
grants sailing without facilitation often do 
so aboard small rubber boats, whereas fa-
cilitation networks continue to advertise 
sea crossings on wooden fishing boats.
Most migrants departed from Libya and about 
a quarter had left from Tunisia and a minor-
ity from Egypt. 
In addition, a few migrants detected near Sic-
ily and the southern Italian coast mentioned 
that they had left from Turkey or were de-
tected after transiting through the Greek 
Island of Crete, sometimes arriving in Crete 
from Athens. 
From Tunisia
The number of Tunisians detected on the 
Central Mediterranean route significantly 
dropped after September 2012, when an 
agreement was reached between Italy and 
Tunisia to repatriate up to 100 Tunisians 
per week. This also coincided with rougher 
sea conditions and the capsizing of a boat 
soon after its departure during which as 
many as 50 casualties have been reported. 
All these factors contributed to deter many 
Tunisians from illegally crossing the Medi-
terranean Sea. 
While most departures from Tunisia in the 
first half of the year took place from southern 
Tunisia, there was of shift to more departures 
from the northern part of the country as of 
September, most probably due to the wors-
ening weather conditions south and west of 
the Pelagic Islands. 
The decreasing trend in departures from 
Tunisia is expected to be reinforced by en-
hanced patrol capacities of the Tunisian au-
thorities. In December, Tunisia received two 
patrol boats, from the Italian Ministry of In-
terior to support the fight against clandes-
tine migration from Tunisia to Italy. A third 
boat of the same type will be handed over 
in early 2013. 
From Libya
Most sub-Saharans detected in the Cen-
tral Mediterranean area in particular from 
Eritrea and Somalia, reported to have de-
parted from Libya, in particular from the 
coastal areas near Tripoli, Zawiya and 
Benghazi. 
Different routes are used to bring the mi-
grants to the Libyan border. In some cases, 
migrants have been reported leaving as far 
away as Chad. 
From Egypt
In 2012, the first detections for illegal bor-
der-crossing in the Central Mediterranean 
area from Egypt occurred in April. Alexandria 
was mentioned as the main area for depar-
tures. Most migrants were promptly read-
mitted to Egypt. 
Nationalities on the Central 
Mediterranean route
Somali migrants
Most detected Somalis were young males 
(18–24 years) with secondary education and 
low or no income. The main reason for the 
migration was socio-economic, but in some 
cases it was military conflict. Many Somali 
migrants mentioned escaping the threat of 
the terrorist group Al Shabab.
29 of 80
Most Somalis were detected by Italian au-
thorities, but in the second quarter of 2012, 
the arrival of Somali migrants in Malta in-
creased significantly to almost 600 during 
that quarter. They had been promised that 
they would be brought to Italy. In the past, 
Malta resettled some Somali migrants in the 
United States and in some Member States, 
which might be a pull factor. 
Somali migrants are also among the most 
commonly detected nationalities using fraud-
ulent documents on intra-Schengen flights. 
Eritrean migrants
Many Eritrean nationals, after leaving their 
home either to avoid military service or in the 
hope of finding better living conditions, gather 
in Kassala and then spend some time in the UN 
refugee camp in Shagarab. They then move 
further to Khartoum, where they stay a few 
months or years either in employment or try-
ing to find some type of job. 
Once they decide to travel further, typically 
Sudanese and Eritrean facilitators assist them 
to reach the border with Libya. In Tripoli the 
local facilitation networks take over the fa-
cilitation arrangements. 
Tunisian migrants 
Most Tunisian migrants were young (18–29 
years) unmarried males with a primary level 
of education and low incomes. Many Tuni-
sians have relatives or friends in the EU ready 
to help them settle in, especially in Italy. Tuni-
sian migrants typically arrived undocumented 
to avoid readmission because Italy and Tuni-
sia cooperate with regard to the repatriation 
of documented Tunisians. After reaching Italy, 
they continue their journey to other Mem-
ber States; the majority travel to France as 
they speak French.
Egyptian migrants
Mostly Egyptian migrants detected crossing 
the Mediterranean Sea to the EU are young 
males (16–19 years), looking for economic op-
portunities in the EU or escaping the current 
tensions between Coptic and Muslim com-
munities. Most of them rely on facilitation 
network operating in Alexandria. Once de-
tected for illegal border-crossing, they are re-
turned to Egypt under bilateral agreements. 
n	Western Mediterranean route 
(sea, Ceuta and Melilla land)
In the Western Mediterranean area, between 
northern Africa and Spain, detection for ille-
gal border-crossing totalled 6 397, represent-
ing a 24% decrease compared to 2011, a level 
comparable to the detections reported be-
tween 2008 and 2010. Most migrants were 
Algerians and sub-Saharans departing from 
Morocco and Algeria.

Nationalities on the Western 
Mediterranean route
Moroccan and Algerian migrants
Moroccan and Algerians migrants were 
mostly single male adults aged 18–30 but 
also a few minors. They spoke Arabic and, 
to a lesser extent, French or English; having 
relatives or friends in Member States, mainly 
in France, Belgium, Germany and Spain, who 
would help them find a job and settle within 
the ethnic communities already established 
in these countries. They were suffering from 
a generalised lack of economic opportunities.
Sub-Saharan migrants (mostly departing 
from Morocco)
While Moroccans themselves still wish to 
migrate to the EU, Morocco can be a com-
paratively stable and wealthy country for 
sub-Saharan migrants. Typically for tran-
sitional countries, Morocco is likely to at-
tract sub-Saharans to migrate and settle in 
Morocco, facilitated by reduced travel costs 
and the increased demand for low and high-
skilled migrant labour.* This trend was con-
firmed by several reports of migrants who 
indicated that an increasing number of mi-
grants, including women and children, from 
sub-Saharan African countries illegally enter 
Morocco with the assistance of smugglers. 
Most sub-Saharans were single adults aged 
25–35. In general, they had a low level of ed-
ucation with a limited knowledge of French 
and/or English. Most travelled through sev-
eral African countries where they worked be-
fore arriving in Morocco; almost all of them 
were undocumented to avoid repatriation af-
ter their disembarkation to Spain. Most had 
relatives or friends in Member States, mainly 
in Spain, France and Germany. Some of them 
claimed socio-economic reasons as well as 
fleeing from social unrest and armed conflicts 
in their home countries as the main motives 
for migrating. Less frequent factors for mi-
grating were religious persecution and the 
marginalisation of women. However, com-
pared to previous years there appeared an 
increasing number of pregnant women and 
children, raising the concern that an increas-
ing number of migrants embarking on this 
route might end up in the hands of organ-
ised crime groups (OCGs) involved in traf-
ficking in human beings. However, during 
the border-crossing, no link could be estab-
lished between their smuggling and possible 
trafficking in human beings.
Modus operandi
Sea crossing
The boats departing from Algeria or Mo-
rocco were mostly rubber dinghies, and fibre 
glass boats. In the Strait of Gibraltar, on aver-
age 8–12 migrants were detected on rubber 
boats that normally have a limited capacity 
of four persons. 
Most migrants departed from the coastal 
area between Tangiers and Ceuta. From Al-
geria, the cities of Mostaganem, Oran and 
Chlef form a triangle where the facilitators 
recruit, accommodate and organise the sea 
crossing. The coastal area between Ghaz-
aouet and Orán is the main departure area 
used in order to reach the coast of Almeria. 
Mostaganem, located on the north coast of 
Algeria between Orán and Tenés, is used to 
reach Murcia.
Land crossing
Due to the repeated attempts of illegal bor-
der-crossing by sub-Saharan migrants to-
wards Melilla and Ceuta, the Moroccan Army 
and Royal Gendarmerie strengthened the po-
lice surveillance in the north of the country. 
In October 2012, the Spanish authorities 
reported several attempts by migrants to 
* Hamburg Institute of 
International Economics, 
Focus migration: Country 
profile: Morocco, 2009.
31 of 80
scale the fence to the enclave of Melilla. 
Some of the attempts took place in broad 
daylight, resulting in more than 300 peo-
ple crossing the border illegally. Most of the 
migrants were of sub-Saharan origin and 
succeeded in jumping the barrier around 
the Oro River. The autonomous city of Me-
lilla has reinforced security along the border 
to try to stem illegal border-crossing, de-
ploying 40 additional Civil Guard officers, 
according to the government’s delegate in 
Melilla. According to media reports, the mi-
grants jumped the six-metre fence equipped 
with sticks and stones, which they used to 
threaten civil guards.
This assault over the fence resulted in the 
local open centre of Immigrant Tempo-
rary Stay Centre (CETI) becoming quickly 
overcrowded. At one point, there were 
853 people staying in the centre which 
only has capacity for 480. Collaboration 
with Moroccan security forces was cru-
cial in foiling migrants’ attempts to scale 
the fences. After October, no other inci-
dent was reported. 
n	Western African route
The police and repatriation agreements that 
Spain signed with Senegal, Mauritania and 
Morocco and the consequent high level of 
cooperation between the Spanish, Senega-
lese and Mauritanian authorities perform-
ing joint patrols at sea and on the coastline 
of Senegal and Mauritania have been a sig-
nificant deterrent factor in preventing ir-
regular migration flows from Senegal and 
Mauritania towards the Canary Islands. JO 
Hera throughout the past 6 years has con-
tributed to close cooperation and daily co-
ordination among the authorities involved in 
preventing irregular immigration.
The level of the detections of illegal border-
crossing towards the Canary Islands remained 
very low indeed in 2012 mostly opportunity 
driven and regional, as the vast majority of 
arrivals concerned Moroccan nationals. This 
represents a steady declining trend from the 
peak in 2006 of more than 31 600 migrants 
arriving illegally in the Canary Islands. 
n	Western Balkan route
The Western Balkan route remained largely 
a function of the transiting flow of migrants 
that enter the EU at the Greek-Turkish bor-
ders and later continue towards other Mem-
ber States through the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia, Serbia and Croa-
tia. Migrants travelling within the EU from 
Greece and further on to other destination 
Member States usually use the fastest pos-
sible route to re-enter the Schengen area 
(Hungary or Slovenia).
Green border crossing
Considering also detections reported by 
Western Balkan countries within the Western 
Balkans Risk Analysis Network, there were 
almost 35 000 detections of illegal border-
crossing between BCPs reported by West-

33% higher compared to 2011. Serbia was by 
far the top reporting country in the region 
with a 40% share of detections
Nationalities on the Western Balkan route
In fact, most of the growth was linked to sec-
ondary movements of Afghans, Pakistanis, Al-
gerians, Somalis, Syrians and Moroccans en 
route from Greece to other Member States. 
Detections of Albanian nationals (Albanian 
circular migration to Greece) remained sta-
ble in comparison with 2011. 
It is notable that the numbers of detec-
tions of illegal border-crossing by Serbia and 
 Croatia in the fourth quarter were higher 
than of any Member State, including Greece. 
More than two-thirds of all detections con-
tinued to be linked to migrants who have 
entered the Western Balkans en route from 
Greece. In terms of nationalities, Afghans 
remained the largest nationality with more 
than 8 000 detections. The number of de-
tected Syrians continued to increase strongly 
during the last quarter of 2012. By the end of 
2012, there were 1 646 Syrians detected for 
illegal border-crossing compared to only 92 
during 2011.
By the end of 2012, nationals of Eritrea were 
the fastest growing group of migrants: their 
number rose from only 20 in the third quarter 
to more than 300 during the fourth quarter. 
Similarly nationals of Mali grew from only 3 in 
the third quarter to 78 in the fourth quarter.
Variations in modi operandi 
There is considerable variation in the modus 
operandi considering the points of departure 
(either straight from Greece or in several legs 
inside the Western Balkans) and types of vehi-
cles used (cars, buses, cargo/passenger trains). 
The route straight from Greece via West-
ern Balkan countries to the EU appears to 
be more costly and organised, while the 
route made in several legs through West-
ern Balkan countries is cheaper and per-
haps more improvised. Inside the Western 
Balkan countries vehicles are most proba-
bly entered at the truck stops. However, ac-
cording to the observations by the Western 
Balkan countries, the lorry drivers are usu-
ally not aware that they are carrying irreg-
ular migrants. 
These trends continue to suggest that more 
migrants en route from Greece are opting 
for crossing the regional and common bor-
ders hidden in vehicles. This modus operandi 
contains a high risk of loss of life, especially 
when closed hidden compartments are used 
in cars, buses, trains, and containers.
Number of asylum applications to 
circumvent entry provisions continued at 
increasing pace
Overall asylum applications by the migrants 
en route from Greece increased substantially 
in most Western Balkan countries. Most no-
tably, the increase was extremely high in 
Montenegro +543%. Claiming asylum in West-
ern Balkans itself and absconding afterwards 
continues to grow as a part of the modus op-
erandi to move from Greece towards other 
Member States (secondary movements).
n	Eastern land borders route
The eastern land borders route is, in effect, 
an amalgam of detections of illegal border-
crossing reported by Lithuania, Slovakia, Ro-
mania, Hungary, Poland, Estonia, Finland and 
Latvia. Despite the total length of all the bor-
der sections, detections tend to be lower than 
on other routes possibly due to the long dis-
tances between major hubs and many coun-
tries of origins. Also visa fraud and counterfeit 
border-crossing stamps tend to predominate 
33 of 80
on this route, as opposed to detections of il-
legal border-crossing.
The number of detections of Somalis at the 
Slovakian land border with Ukraine repre-
sented a steady long-term increase over 
many years.
n	Other routes
There was very little detection for illegal bor-
der-crossing elsewhere in the EU. In the Bal-
tic Sea region, Member States reported only 
25 detections in 2012. These detections were 
related to very few events. In this region, 
the main issue for authorities patrolling the 
blue border is the non-systematic control of 
pleasure boats.
3.3.2. Clandestine entry
Detections of illegal border-crossing at (rather 
than between) BCPs are restricted to the ex-
ternal land and sea borders of the EU and to 
detections that are confirmed clandestine 
entries (e.g. hiding in means of transport). 
Their volume is extremely low for the whole 
of the EU, with 605 detections in 2012, espe-
cially compared with other indicators, such 
as detections of illegal border-crossing be-
tween BCPs (72 437). However, the 2012 to-
tal is still the highest number of clandestine 
entry detections since data collection began 
for this indicator in 2009. 
This method requires migrants to stay in 
confinement for long periods of time, and is 
known to put migrants lives at risk of suffoca-
tion and dehydration. Therefore, most of the 
migrants detected hiding in vehicles at BCPs 
are single young males, and do not travel in 
more-vulnerable family groups. 
There were also more detections within the 
EU/Schengen area (3 467), which was also 
the highest number recorded in recent years. 
The geographical distribution of those detec-
tions sheds light on the direction of secondary 
movements and the final destination coun-
tries selected by specific nationalities. For ex-
ample, Italy, the UK and Romania reported 
the greatest number of internally detected 
clandestine migrants, mostly Afghans, Alba-
nians and Algerians. For smuggling within the 
EU, there are reports that the ferry route be-
tween the Greek ports of Patras and Igou-
menitsa towards Italy are important, as are 
routes from ports heading towards the UK. 
In Italy, most Afghans were detected mak-
ing secondary movements on ferries arriv-
ing in Venice from Greece, as well as recent 
increases in the number of Palestinians on 
ferries arriving in Venice and Ancona, where 
both nationalities are often also detected 
with fraudulent documents.
Modus operandi
In vehicles
In 2012, clandestine entry in lorries was one of 
the most frequent and increasingly detected 
methods. A large proportion of the clandes-
tines were detected with carbon dioxide de-
tection or heartbeat detection devices. 
Figure 12. In 2012, hiding in means of

At the BCPs on the land border between Bul-
garia and Turkey, a big part of clandestine 
entry is associated with the annual move-
ment of Turkish ‘guest workers’, (about two 
million pass annually through Kapitan An-
dreevo and Lesovo BCPs) going to and from 
Turkey mainly to Germany, Belgium and the 
Netherlands. Many of these migrants try to 
smuggle relatives through the Bulgarian bor-
der (between two and three attempts are 
detected each day during peak times of the 
year – May to September).*
In the Western Balkans, detections of mi-
grants hiding in vehicles continued to in-
crease in 2012. There were almost 1 676 (87% 
increase compared to 2011) migrants de-
tected in vehicles at different regional BCPs 
while trying to clandestinely avoid border 
checks. 
On trains
Detections of clandestine on trains con-
cerned relatively few of the BCPs along the 
EU’s external borders. However, in 2012, 
Member States reported increasing re-
ports of migrants hiding on trains as part 
of the secondary movements of migrants 
who initially entered illegally into the EU 
via Turkey. 
In Romania, there was a significant increase in 
the number of migrants hidden in the means 
of transport, mainly because many migrants 
who entered at the border with Serbia and 
applied for asylum subsequently left the asy-
lum centres and were then discovered hid-
den in trains exiting towards Hungary. Many 
of them tried to board the trains going to 
Hungary after the border checks had been 
performed.
Another emerging trend in 2012 is the detec-
tions of secondary movement of migrants 
hiding in trains from Thessaloniki (Greece) 
to Linz (Austria).
In containers / ships
Detections of migrants hiding in containers 
on ships are low, and confined to the larg-
est container ports of the EU. Yet, in some 
ports, like in the port of Algeciras, there are 
regular detections, mostly associated with 
migrants hiding in lorries on the ferries be-
tween Morocco and Spain. 
3.4. Detections of facilitators
Despite an increase from 6 957 in 2011 to 7 720 
in 2012, the long term trend for detections of 
facilitators of irregular migration has been 
falling. In 2008 and 2009, there were more 
than 9 000 detections. 
According to some reports, this long-term 
decline may in part be due to a widespread 
shift towards the abuse of legal channels and 
document fraud to mimic legal entry to the 
EU, which results in facilitators being able to 
operate remotely and inconspicuously rather 
than accompanying migrants during high-risk 
activities such as border-crossing.
The total EU-level detections of facilitators 
of irregular migration tend to be made up of 
several disparate trends involving unrelated 
nationalities detected in different Member 
States. For example, despite a decline in de-
tections compared to the year previously, 
France reported the most detections of fa-
cilitators, whereas Spain ranked second at 
EU level. Hungary reported a large increase, 
mostly of Serbs and Hungarians detected 
inland and at the border with Serbia. This 
increase is most probably connected to facil-
itation of secondary movements of migrants, 
after they have entered Greece illegally from 
Turkey. 
Member States tend to detect more domes-
tic facilitators than any other nationality; in 
2012, all of the top three reporting countries 
for this indicator reported their own citizens 
* Center for the Study 
of Democracy, Better 
Management of EU borders 
through Cooperation, 2011
35 of 80
as facilitators more frequently than any other 
single nationality. Among the countries re-
porting the most facilitators this propensity 
was strongest in Italy and Spain, where about 
a third of all detected facilitators were of their 
own nationals. In France, this proportion is 
about a fifth of all detections.
In 2012, there were several investigations that 
led to a number of important arrests. In many 
cases, the investigations revealed that facil-
itators, not only provide assistance to cross 
the border illegally, but also facilitate the stay 
of irregular migrants in Member States by 
providing fraudulent documents. 
In Spain, an investigation launched in March 
resulted in the arrest of ten facilitators who 
had been smuggling migrants from Turkey to 
Greece. Once inside the Schengen area, mi-
grants were supplied with residence permits 
through marriage or domestic partnership 
with citizens. Apparently, this organisation was 
also actively engaged in narcotics trafficking.
In Italy, there were several developments in 
relation to migrant smuggling from Egypt 
and through the Western Balkans. For ex-
ample, the police dismantled a criminal or-
ganisation that operated for years between 
Egypt and the Sicilian coastline. Also, a well 
branched criminal organisation which oper-
ated between Turkey and Italy was disman-
tled during the reporting period. This group 
used the Western Balkan route, aimed at the 
illegal entry of Turkish citizens who crossed 
the land border between Italy and Slovenia 
hidden aboard vehicles and/or using false 
documents.
A Chinese people-smuggling network, op-
erating European-wide, was dismantled by 
the French Police (OCRIEST) in June 2012, 
with Europol’s support. Eleven suspects were 
arrested. Another facilitator had previously 
been arrested in the UK. The network smug-
gled Chinese irregular migrants from France, 
Spain and Portugal to Ireland and the UK us-
ing forged passports from different Asian 
countries. After several intercepted smug-
gling attempts, and the arrest of some of the 
organisers, the network changed their modus 
operandi and started smuggling the migrants 
hidden in the trunks of cars loaded on lorries. 
 As is true for other serious organised crimes, 
facilitators of irregular migration make an 
extensive use of the internet according to 
Europol reports. It allows OCGs to get in-
formation about legislation, procedures, etc., 
and can be used for recruitment of migrants, 
to transfer money and to engage in anony-
mous communication. In China, for example, 
agencies use Chinese websites and news-
papers to market immigration to specific 
Member States as a way of gaining social ben-
efits or the possibility to move freely within 
Schengen. Diaspora communities in desti-
nation countries can be a facilitator for re-
cruitment. In addition, some asylum centres 
function as recruitment hubs, where OCGs 
find a large potential customer base for the 
onward smuggling route. 
According to Europol, facilitation of irregu-
lar immigration is usually nationality- or eth-
nicity-based and the OCGs are hierarchically 
structured. The leader is responsible for the 
coordination of the smuggling throughout a 
certain territory, and has international con-
tacts with other networks doing other parts 
of the smuggling action, and with coordina-
tors in other countries. The leader coordinates 
drivers, guides, providers of accommodation 
often assisted by ‘local agents’. 
Local persons of the nationality of the transit 
country retain their importance on the exec-
utive level of the facilitation network. They 
are local guides to illegally cross the green 
borders. For example on the Balkan routes, 
the use of Serbian and Hungarian guides was 
reported. They can be drivers for local dis-
tances or for transportation into the destina-
Frontex · annual risk analysis 2013

tion country, for example Afghan organisers 
recruiting Romanian lorry drivers. 
Leadership can also be based on family rela-
tionships. In some cases opportunistic indi-
viduals can also be involved in facilitation of 
irregular migration.
Europol also indicates that there is no specific 
link between the modus operandi and the na-
tionality of the facilitator. For example, one 
Albanian-speaking OCG may be involved in 
clandestine entry, while another organise 
marriages of convenience. 
3.5. Document fraud
Document fraud is widely acknowledged by 
the EU border-guard community to be a se-
rious problem not only because it allows mi-
grants in irregular or unlawful situations to 
enter the territory of a Member State, and 
potentially also to move freely within the 
Schengen area, but also because it make it 
possible for individuals to assume a bogus 
identity and operated within the black mar-
ket. This seriously affects internal security, 
and undermines international criminal inves-
tigations, as well national social systems and 
the ability of any state to effectively man-
age and protect its legitimate communities. 
As modern documents require increasingly 
sophisticated and expensive techniques to 
produce quality forgeries, document fraud-
sters progressively need closer and stronger 
links to organised crime groups, which also 
increases their profits.
It is generally recognised that the abuse of 
travel documents fall in four broad categories: 
n  forgeries – previously authentic docu-
ments that have been tampered with;
n  counterfeits – entirely manufactured doc-
uments made to resemble originals;
n  fraudulently obtained documents – au-
thentic documents that were issued based 
on fraudulent applications or supporting 
documents;
n  impostors – authentic documents being 
used by an unauthorised user (look-alikes).
The abuse of EU passports is of particu-
lar concern because migrants using them 
may be subject to less rigorous checks at 
the external border, and because the doc-
ument may be used to access social sys-

tems or be reused for other migrants to 
attempt illegal entry. Another major is-
sue relates to fraudulently obtained visas, 
which raise particular challenges for first-
line officers to detect, especially given lin-
guistic differences and fact that migrants 
are often not required to cross the exter-
nal border of the same Member State that 
issued the visa. Some of these issues will be 
addressed by the Visa Information System 
(VIS) which should be operational among 
issuing authorities across eleven regions 
by November 2013. 
According to EDF-RAN data, in 2012 there 
were nearly 8 000 detections of migrants 
using fraudulent documents to illegally enter 
the EU/Schengen area from third countries, 
which is a substantial increase compared to 
previous years. Much of this increase was 
due to higher pressure at the external bor-
der in terms of migrants using, inter alia, 
counterfeit stamps or forged passports to 
illegally enter Member States from third 
countries. 
However, at least some of the increase can 
probably be attributed to a gradually in-
creased focus on consistent and well-de-
fined reporting within the framework of 
the EDF-RAN. 
In previous years, most detections were 
made at the major EU airports, but in 2012 
there were more detections at the external 
land (56%) than at both the air (39%) and sea 
borders (5%). The reason for the switch was 
a massive increase in the number of Alba-
nian nationals detected at their land border 
with Greece, using counterfeit border-cross-
ing stamps to fabricate travel histories and 
extend periods of stay. This trend, involving 
mostly circular migrants, would have begun 
in 2011 once Albanians were granted visa-
free access to the Schengen area.
Albanians were also increasingly detected 
travelling from the Schengen to the UK and, 
to a lesser extent, to Ireland.
Away from the land border, detections 
tended to be focused at the major inter-
national airports, with Fiumicino (FCO), 
Lisbon (LIS), Madrid (MAD), Brussels (BRU) 
and Frankfurt (FRA) detecting the most in-
dividuals on arrival. Each of the top airports 
detected more passports than any other 
document, mostly forgeries, but at Lisbon 
more authentic passports (unknown nation-
alities) and at Frankfurt more counterfeit 
passports (Syrians) were detected than any 
other type of fraud. Among these passport 
holders, most airports detected a wide va-
riety of nationalities throughout 2012, with 
particularly noticeable numbers of Bangla-
deshi migrants detected in Fiumicino, Syr-
ians in Frankfurt, Fiumicino and Warsaw, 
and Congolese (DMR) in Brussels.

The European Union Document-Fraud Risk Analysis 
Network
Despite the recognised seriousness of document fraud, until 
recently there was no regular or consolidated information 
exchange among Member States and there were no overall 
analyses of trends in the field of document fraud at EU level. 
To address this information gap and following on from the 
success of an earlier pilot study, the European Union Docu-
ment-Fraud Risk Analysis Network (EDF-RAN) was formed 
in early 2012 to serve as a platform for information exchange 
among Member States. 
Overseen by Frontex, during 2012 some 28 Member States/
Schengen Associated Countries met and exchanged infor-
mation on several occasions, and instigated and maintained 
a detailed and complex monthly data-exchange programme 
covering all detections of document fraud at the external 
borders and on all international flights. Data were ex-
changed detailing the migrant, the document and the 
route taken – all at the level of individual events.
Nationalities of document fraudsters
Albanians were the most commonly detected 
nationality using document fraud to illegally 
enter the EU/Schengen area from a third 
country. The other top five nationalities were 
Syrian (see section on Syrian migrants), Mo-
roccan, Ukrainian and Nigerian.
Consistent with previous years, migrants from 
Morocco were mostly detected in Spain, using 
authentic Spanish ID cards to attempt entry 
to Ceuta or Melilla. Elsewhere, more Moroc-
cans were detected at the Italian than at the 
Spanish air border, suggesting that Moroc-
cans attempting entry at the air border pre-
fer to target countries where border guards 
may have less experience in controlling them 
than Spanish border guards.
Ukrainians were detected in decreasing num-
bers also using counterfeit stamps attempt-
ing entry to Poland and, to a lesser extent, 
Hungary and Slovakia.
Nigerians have been in the top five for de-
tections of document fraud for several years 
and in 2012 were slightly more detected than 
in 2011. The most commonly abused docu-
ments by Nigerian nationals were authentic 
and forged Nigerian passports and counter-
feit French visas.
Embarkation points
More than two thirds of all detections on 
entry at the air border from a third country 
were of migrants with known places of em-
barkation. In 2012, Istanbul was used by doc-
ument fraudsters attempting illegal entry to 
the EU/Schengen area with the largest overall 
number of detections, and with Syrians and 
Iranians being the most common nationali-
ties. The significance of this route is likely to 
increase in 2013 while the Greek operation 
Aspida is still active at the Greek land bor-
der with Turkey. 
Other top embarkation points tended to 
be most associated with migrants local to 
each region. For example the second most 
common embarkation point for document 
fraudsters in 2012 was Lagos, where Nigerian 
migrants dominated. Similarly Casablanca, 
which ranked third, was where most Mo-
roccans embarked and Tunis, which ranked 
fourth, was mostly used by Tunisians.
Syrian migrants
In 2012, there was a very significant increase 
in detections of Syrian nationals using docu-
ment fraud to illegally enter the EU/Schengen 
area from third countries, from below 100 de-
tections in 2011 to nearly 500 in 2012. More-
over, the number of detections increases to 
over 1 200 once detections on intra-Schen-
gen flights (~500) and movement between 
the Schengen area and the UK and are also 
included. Hence, Syrian migrants represent a 
significant and increasing risk of document 
fraud to illegally enter and move within the 
EU/Schengen area. They were most com-
monly detected on entry to German airports 
on flights from Athens and Istanbul.
On entry to the EU/Schengen area from 
third countries, Syrian migrants were most 
commonly detected with counterfeit Turk-
ish passports and ID cards, and stolen blank 
German passports. In contrast, while trav-
elling within the Schengen area, counter-
feit Greek ID cards and stolen blank Greek 
residence permits were most frequently 
detected. Overall there were also many in-
stances of authentic Syrian passports and 
Bulgarian and Romanian documents. In each 
case the issuing authority of these docu-
ments probably reflected place of embarka-
tion and probably also access to facilitators 
of the same nationality.
The EDF-ARA 2012 highlighted the increasing 
trend of document fraud being used by mi-
grants making secondary movements on in-
39 of 80
tra-Schengen flights from Greece, and during 
the first half of 2012 this was particularly the 
case for Syrian migrants. However, following 
the start of the Greek operation Aspida in 
August 2012, there was a noticeable decline 
in the number of document fraudsters of all 
nationalities including Syrians arriving on in-
tra-Schengen flights from Athens. However, if 
detections on exit from Athens are also taken 
into account the decline of Syrians was less 
dramatic. Subsequent to the operation As-
pida, all nationalities were detected in much 
lower frequencies because fewer migrants 
were entering Greece from Turkey. This de-
cline may also be partly explained by more 
expensive flights during the summer period, 
forcing many migrants to make secondary 
movements via cheaper means than air travel. 
Elsewhere in the region, there was a con-
current increase in the number of document 
fraudsters of many nationalities particularly 
Syrians arriving in Schengen airports on 
flights from Istanbul, supporting the theory 
that many migrants are waiting in Turkey 
rather than crossing the border into Greece 
or Bulgaria.
3.6. Refusals of entry
While most refusals of entry are reported 
from the land and air borders, in line with 
the distribution of passenger flows, the long-
term trend is an increase at the land bor-
der and a decrease at the air borders. These 
long-term trends are assumed to be linked 
with increasing passenger flow at the land 
border, but the lack of detailed data on reg-
ular passenger flow does not allow for de-
tailed analysis. 
There were large increases in refusals of en-
try at the Polish land borders with Belarus 
(due to an increase in refusals of entry is-
sued to Georgians, which peaked in Octo-
ber) and Ukraine. However, these increases 
were offset by a decrease in refusals of en-
try issued at other border sections, like at 
the land border between Greece and Alba-
nia, but also decreases reported at some air-
ports, resulting in a stable total at EU level 
compared to 2011 (115 305, -3%).
In 2012, the sharpest increase was the in-
crease in refusals of entry of Georgian nation-
als at the Polish border with Belarus, most of 
it (75%) during the second half of 2012. Be-
tween June and December 2012, the number 
of refusals of entry issued to Georgians at the 
Polish land border with Belarus was three 
times as high as between January and June. 
The vast majority were refused for Reason C 
No valid visa. This was confirmed by JO Focal 
Point reports in which the majority of Geor-
gians were refused for not having a valid visa 
or residence permit (C) or an alert had been 
issued in the SIS or national database (H).
The phenomenon of increased numbers of re-
fused Georgians is likely to lead to an increase 
in Georgians illegally staying in other Member 
States, in particular Sweden and Germany. 
Nationalities
Despite increased numbers of Georgians 
refused entry to Poland, the most common 
nationality refused entry at a single border 
section was Ukrainian nationals refused

Ukrainians, who ranked first for refusals 
of entry at EU level, were refused entry 
to Poland for a variety of reasons, partic-
ularly Reason C No valid visa, and Reason 
E No justification. 
The majority of Albanians continued to be 
refused at the BCP Kakavia, one of the main 
border-crossing points at the Greek–Alba-
nian border. The main reported reasons for 
refusal of entry were an alert issued in the SIS 
or national database (H), false travel docu-
ment (B) or not having appropriate documen-
tation justifying the purpose and conditions 
of stay (E).
At the air borders, Brazilians still rank first for 
refusals of entry, but on a decreasing trend 
with less then 3 000 refusals of entry in 2012, 
compared to more than 10 000 in 2008. 
The same decreasing trend is observed for 
other Latin American nationalities, all of them 
sharply decreasing between 2011 and 2012, like 
nationals from Venezuela (836, -37%), Para-
guay (595, -55%).
In the UK, US nationals represent a large 
proportion of refusals of entry but they are 
not linked to irregular migration. Indeed, US 
passengers represent far more arrivals than 
other passengers, and the refusals of entry 
issued to them are mostly technical and not 
assessed by the UK authorities as a threat 
of irregular migration to the EU. This shows 
the importance of analysing refusals of en-
try against passenger flows, as otherwise the 
conclusions can be misleading.
3.7. Detections of illegal stay
In 2012, there were 344 928 detections of ille-
gal stay in the EU, which represents a gener-
ally stable trend compared to the year before 
and recent reporting periods. This is consist-
ent with a stable but slightly declining long-
term trend over the past five years (Fig. 16). 
In 2008, there were 441 237 detections of il-
legal stay, or 28% more than in 2012.
In the following analysis of detections of il-
legal stay it has to be borne in mind that in 
2012 the Netherlands, for technical reasons, 
only reported detections on exit and not de-
tections made inland, which in 2011 amounted 
to about 6 000. Also in Sweden many asy-
lum applicants were also reported as illegal 
stayers, raising the total number of detec-
tions of illegal stay in Sweden.
While the number of detections of illegal stay 
declined in many Member States, it increased 
or remained unchanged in some. There are 
multiple reasons for these developments, in-
cluding indirect ones such as visa liberalisa-
tion and the economic crisis in the EU. Also 
crucial in explaining the long-term decline 
are factors such as effective legislation, pol-
icies and their implementation in the form 
practical measures.
The declines since 2008, in terms of volume 
and trends, have been the strongest in Spain 
(-53%), France (-61%), Italy (-52%) and Portugal

(-67%). In contrast, Germany reported con-
siderable increases between 2008 and 2012 
(+62%). Consequently, it ranked first for de-
tections of illegal stay.
The vast majority of illegal stayers were de-
tected inland (278 438 detections, or 81% of 
the total) and so are presumed to be long-
term overstayers as they were making no 
 attempt to leave at the time of detection. The 
next most common location for detections 
of illegal stayers was those exiting at the air 
(35 410 detections or 10% of the total) fol-
lowed by the land borders (19 883 detections, 
or 5%) whereby illegally staying migrants 
were leaving the EU or the Schengen area. 
Nationalities
The long-term trend also varies according to 
nationalities. Although Afghans, Moroccans 
and Algerians have been among the top five 
since 2008, Pakistanis, ranking third in 2012, 
only appeared in the top ten after 2010. De-
tections of Tunisians considerably increased 
after the Arab Spring, and in 2012, were still 
above 15 000 detections.
Marriage of convenience

the Misuse of the Right to Family Reunifica-
tion released in June 2012, whilst the percep-
tion among policy makers, and the media in 
particular, indicates that misuse of the right

hood may be a widespread phenomenon, the 
evidence suggests that, while marriages of 
convenience do occur, it is not yet possible 
to fully quantify it across all Member States 
in a comparable manner. Where misuse has 
been detected, this seems to be primarily for 
marriages of convenience rather than false 
declarations of parenthood.
Member States face many challenges when 
distinguishing a marriage of convenience from 
a genuine marriage. Not only is this a sen-
sitive matter in terms of respecting funda-
mental rights, and Member States are fully 
committed to their obligations in this respect, 
but such investigations tend to be very time-
consuming and resource-intensive with the 
burden of proof most often placed on the 
Member State authorities. 
Students
Overall, at EU level, the extent of the abuse 
of student visa is unknown. Gauging from the 
responses by Member States, the phenom-
enon seem to vary widely among Member 
States. The UK made changes to Tier 4 (stu-
dent tier) of their Points-Based System to 
tackle abuse, including by increasing the level 
of English language proficiency and imposing 
additional requirements on educational insti-
tutions. In contrast, twelve Member States 
took steps in simplifying procedures for stu-
dents to enter and stay on their territory as 
this is seen as a way to import skilled and ed-
ucated foreigners. 
3.8. Asylum applications
In 2012, there were more applications for asy-
lum in the EU since FRAN data collection be-
gan in early 2008 (note that data for France 
and the Netherlands only include applications 
made at the border). The number of claims 
increased from 2011 to 2012 to reach 272 208 
applications. Germany ranked first with a 
quarter of all asylum applications in the EU.
Both the number of claims and the num-
ber of applicants increased by 7% between 
2011 and 2012. 
Considering the total of applications, while 
Afghans still rank first, the most significant 
trend was the increased applications sub-
mitted by Syrian nationals, which in 2012 
increased to nearly 22 424 applications, com-
pared to 8 180 applications in 2011. This rep-
resented the most major influx of asylum 
seekers for many years. Of these asylum seek-
ers two-thirds were reported by Sweden and 
Germany.
Nevertheless, regarding the total of appli-
cants, more than 32 000 asylum seekers from 
Western Balkans (visa-exempt nationalities) 
applied in the EU in 2012. Then Afghans with 
27 630 applicants (-13% in comparison with 
2011, 29 672) and Syrians, 22 424 applicants 
(+172% in comparison with 2011, 8 180). 
Syrian migrants have been reported to arrive 
from Istanbul with Swedish genuine pass-
ports used as impostors, as well as some 
forged EU passports and forged or stolen 
blank Greek residence permits. However, 
many Syrians also arrived from Istanbul with 
Turkish Airlines in possession of genuine Syr-
ian passports without any visas or permits.
The number of Russian applications also in-
creased between 2011 and 2012, due to in-
creases reported by Poland; 16 350 applicants 
(+26% in comparison with 2011, 12 936). Most 
of the applications of Russian nationals in Po-
land are believed to be connected with Rus-
sians of Chechen origins. 
Since Frontex started to develop the Post 
Visa-Liberalisation Monitoring Mechanism 
(PVLMM) for the European Commission in 
2011, following the introduction of a visa-
free regime for Western Balkan countries 
(Serbia, the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro) in 
43 of 80
2012, the number of asylum applications of 
Western Balkan nationals in 2012 was the 
largest recorded. In 2012, a total of 32 886 
asylum applications were filed in the EU by 
the Western Balkan visa-exempt nation-
alities. This represents an increase of 53% 
compared to 2011. 
Most asylum seekers from the Western Bal-
kans continue to travel to the EU overland, 
using regular bus connections. By and large, 
entry into the EU occurs at the Hungarian-
Serbian or Slovenian-Croatian border.
Given the growing trend of the phenomenon 
in the past two years, there are now discus-
sions in the EU regarding the possible rein-
troduction of the visa regime. Frontex Post 
Visa-Liberalisation Monitoring Mechanism 
is an essential instrument supporting these 
discussions.
3.9. Returns
Return decisions issued
In 2012, there were 269 949 third-country na-
tionals subject to an obligation to leave the 
EU as a result of an administrative or judicial 
decision, which was a 17% increase compared 
to 2011. However, much of this change was 
due to new definitions applied to this indi-
cator by Italy in early 2012. Not considering 
data from Italy, the annual increase was of 
2%. Nevertheless, the absolute total number 
of migrants subject to return decisions is still 
underestimated by this indicator, as data on 
decisions were unavailable from France, the 
Netherlands and Sweden, which countries 
only reported effective returns and where it 
is assumed that high numbers of decisions 
were issued.
Slightly more than half of the total reported 
decisions at EU level were issued in just three 
Member States: Greece, the UK and Italy. In 
Greece, most decisions were taken for Paki-
stanis and Afghans. These decisions amount 
to large numbers of requests to leave the 
country within 30 days, most of which are 
routinely ignored by migrants who instead 
continue with their secondary movements 
to other Member States. In the UK, most re-
turn decisions were taken for Indians and Pa-
kistani, whereas in Belgium they were mostly 
taken for North Africans (Algerians, Moroc-
cans and Tunisians). 
Effective returns
In 2012, there was a steady trend of 159 490 
third-country nationals effectively returned 
to outside the EU. The UK was the Member 
State conducting the largest number of re-
turns, with steady trends of returned nation-
als from India and Pakistan. Although from 
lower bases, some of the biggest increases 
at the EU level compared to the year be-
fore included Serbian nationals (from 4 948 
to 7 494, +51%).
Type of return
It is difficult to evaluate the overall cost-
effectiveness of return measures against 
other practical measures taken to reduce 
irregular migration. However, forced re-
turns are recognised as being more costly 
than voluntary return, although Member 
States highlight the importance of return 
flights (including those co-ordinated by 
Frontex) in ensuring effective return, as 
well as in acting as a deterrent effect for 
future irregular migrants.*
Within the number of effective returns to 
third countries, about half were reported to 
be on voluntary basis and half were forced 
return. The UK and Poland reported the larg-
est number of voluntary return, and Greece, 
the UK and France accounted for nearly half 
of the forced return. Most of the forced re-
turn concerned Albanians returned by Greece, 
followed by Pakistanis.

* European Migration 
Network Synthesis 
Report, Practical Measures 
to Reduce Irregular 
Migration, 2012
Since 2010 in Norway, most people who 
applied for assisted voluntary return have 
been offered graded reintegration sup-
port. The amount offered in support is up 
to NOK 20 000 (EUR 2 700). The only con-
dition is that people apply for voluntary re-
turn before the deadline that has been set 
for leaving Norway. Since 19 July 2012, fam-
ilies who have been refused asylum in Nor-
way are offered NOK  10 000 (EUR  1  350) 
per child in addition to the NOK 20 000 
per adult if they return voluntarily to their 
country of origin. This support is meant to 
encourage families who have been illegal 
in Norway for many years to apply for vol-
untary return.
The Norwegian authorities have closely 
monitored the system in order to detect 
possible misuse and to monitor the possi-
ble pull-factor effect. Earlier this year, Nor-
way experienced a sudden increase in the 
number of asylum seekers from Belarus. 
Many applied for assisted voluntary return 
suspiciously shortly after they were regis-
tered as asylum seekers. 
In March, it was decided that IOM return-
ees from Belarus were no longer entitled to 
receive subsistence allowance or reintegra-
tion grant. Since June, Georgians have also 
been temporarily excluded from the finan-
cial support scheme.
In Greece, several measures taken by the 
Greek authorities to counter irregular mi-
gration (Xenios Zeus and Aspida), the contin-
uously worsening labour demand prompted 
many to opt for voluntary return. In 2012, a 
total of 6 324 people — most of whom were 
from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh and 
Iraq, — left Greece with the IOM program, 
and a further 800 were repatriated by a 
scheme funded by Norway. Among them, 
about 360 took part in resettlement pro-
grammes that included special assistance 
for opening businesses, or training, which 
were provided as an incentive to help them 
stay in their country.
3.10. Other illegal activities
This section is an overview of cross-border 
crime affecting the work of border guards 
at the external borders of the EU. The anal-
ysis is structured around the following is-
sues: smuggling of illicit drugs, trafficking 
in human beings, terrorist threats, smug-
gling of weapons, stolen vehicles (on exit), 
smuggling of excise goods (cigarettes and 
oil products). 
3.10.1. Smuggling of illicit drugs
Seizures in 2012 demonstrate a continued 
demand for conventional drugs in the EU, 
but they also show a trend towards an in-
creasingly diversified market of new, mainly 
synthetic drugs. This development poses ad-
ditional challenges to authorities along the 
EU external borders, particularly requiring im-
proved training and means of identification.

lem is currently subsiding. However, studies 
claim that heroin is likely to be replaced by 
other substances such as synthetic opioids, 
methamphetamine, cathinones and benzo-
diazepines. UNODC also estimates that due 
to the existing a customs union between the 
Russian Federation, Kazakhstan and Belarus, 
the deliveries of opiate products to Europe 
will see a displacement from the Balkan route 
to the Northern route, which leads through 
Central Asia.**
Heroin is not the only illicit substance system-
atically smuggled along the Balkan route. In 
2012, 657 kg of Marijuana was seized through 
Frontex Joint Operations at the borders to 
Croatia, Albania, Serbia and Turkey. The larg-
est related shipment was detected in Oc-
tober 2012 at the Hungarian BCP Kelebia, 
when a citizen of the former Yugoslav Re-
public of Macedonia attempted to smuggle 
492 kg of Marijuana concealed under a dou-
ble wall of his empty van. Cannabis from Al-
bania to mainly Greece, Italy, and the former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is reported 
again in large amounts, after Albanian law 
enforcement managed to destroy produc-
tion capacities in many rural areas. While in 
2011, around 3.7 tonnes of cannabis herb have 
been seized by Albanian authorities, the num-
ber more than doubled in 2012. 
Western Balkan route
Around 85% of the globally consumed heroin 
is produced from Afghan opium. Large parts 
of this substance are trafficked through Iran, 
Turkey, and South East Europe towards Cen-
tral and Western Europe, along the so-called 
Western Balkan route. Europol reports that 
large quantities of heroin continue to be im-
ported via Turkey using freight or passenger 
vehicles, and Turkish OCGs have established 
themselves in key EU countries to maintain 
control further down the supply chain. In 
2012, border guards together with custom 
officers detected a total amount of 86 kg 
of heroin through Frontex Joint Operations 
in Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, and Slovenia. 
Most seizures were related to single travel-
lers who concealed smaller amounts on their 
bodies or in cavities of their cars. Other de-
tections, however, showed the reappearance 
of larger scale heroin shipments along the 
Balkan route – a phenomenon that seemed 
to decrease during 2011. On 9 August, 21.8 kg 
of heroin were found in the tank of a Bos-
nian lorry during JO Focal Point Land. In No-
vember, Frontex border guards searched the 
car of a Bulgarian citizen and found 10.8 kg 
of heroin packed in 21 bags under the rear 
seats of the vehicle. 
In its largest single heroin seizure ever, the 
Austrian customs authority detected 130 kg 
of heroin packed in 230 parcels that were 
hidden in hollow cavities of a Bulgarian cool-
ing van. Only an x-ray device for lorries and 
test drillings were able to confirm the ini-
tial suspicion of the participating officers. 
The perpetrators smuggled the load along 
the Balkan route into Bulgaria and planned 
to transport it to one of the Benelux coun-
tries.* Also Greece is a major entry door for 
heroin to the EU.
Although future developments are hard to 
predict, a decrease in seizures, availability 
and market prices show that the heroin prob-

The Bulgarian BCP Kapitan Andreevo to Tur-
key is a particularly vulnerable border-cross-
ing point along the Balkan route with a very 
large amount of regular traffic. Law-enforce-
ment activities at Kapitan Andreevo regained 
momentum in May 2012, after Bulgarian anti-
organised crime police uncovered and dis-
rupted a corruption scheme involving dozens 
of customs officers. Frontex JO Focal Points 
Land assisted in revealing numerous attempts 
of drug contraband at this BCP. In one case, 
Frontex officers detected 33 kg of heroin in 
the tank of a van driven by a Serbian citizen, 
who intended to transport the illicit load from 
Turkey to Serbia. 
Western Mediterranean route
The Western Mediterranean route is exten-
sively utilised for the smuggling of cannabis 
products from Morocco. Moreover, organ-
ised crime groups smuggle cocaine from 
Latin America through West Africa, subse-
quently using boats and airplanes on their 
way towards Europe. Europol reports that 
the Iberian Peninsula, in particular Spain, is 
considered to be the main entry point for co-
caine arriving in Europe.
Most of the cannabis resin consumed in 
Europe has traditionally been produced in 
Morocco and smuggled through Spain into 
the EU. Simultaneously, the Africa-Frontex 
Intelligence Community Joint Report 2012 
assumes that a growing amount of canna-
bis from West Africa is smuggled out of the 
region and may reach Europe through the 
Mediterranean Sea. Additionally, Afghan-
istan’s growing cannabis production and 
indoor cultivation within the EU is increas-
ingly challenging Morocco’s dominance as 
a supplier.*
Like in 2011, JO Minerva 2012 has been par-
ticularly successful in revealing these illicit 
shipments. The operational areas of this op-
eration were the maritime border-crossing 
points at the ferry ports of Algeciras, Tarifa 
and Ceuta of Spain. The number of drug de-
tections during this operation rose by 6.6% 
to 209, thereby confiscating almost 5 tonnes 
of hashish and 35 kg of Cocaine. 260 persons 
were involved in the smuggling attempts, 61% 
of the perpetrators were of Moroccan and 
26% of Spanish nationality. In many cases, the 
smugglers attached the drugs to their bod-
ies, swallowed them, or hid them in hollow 
cavities of their cars and lorries.

In December, Spanish authorities dis-
banded a criminal organisation that 
controlled the entire trafficking chain 
from production to packaging, trans-
port from Morocco to Spain, storage, 
and the redistribution across Europe – 
mainly to France, Belgium, the UK and

periodic drug shipments on trucks using 
ferries into the EU, whereby the mari-
juana was hidden in double floors of 
truck fuel tanks. National Police agents 
have seized more than 11 tonnes of hash-

The amount of hashish seized during JO EPN 
Indalo increased by 147% between 2011 and 
2012. This operation took place along the 
Spanish coast between Granada and Mal-
aga and led to the arrest of 84 persons who 
attempted to ship 30 tonnes of hashish into 
the EU. In many cases smugglers used rub-
ber boats or fast jet skis to reach the Span-
ish coast. The operation revealed that the 
facilitation of irregular migration and the 
smuggling of drugs from Morocco are geo-
graphically and organisationally separated. 
For the second year in a row the JO EPN In-
dalo has been used as platform for EU in-
ter-agency cooperation between Frontex, 
CeCLAD-M, EFCA and Europol. At least five 
drug-related incidents were reported dur-
ing JO Hera, which took place between July 
and December between the Canary Islands 
and Morocco. The operation led to the con-
fiscation of 3 146  kg of hashish and the ar-
rest of 13 smugglers.
Cocaine trafficking from South America 
to Europe yields higher profits than to the 
United States and remains therefore strong. 
This trend was exemplified by a shipment of 
3.2 tonnes of cocaine aboard the Bulgarian 
vessel Sveti Nikolay, which Spanish law-en-
forcement authorities intercepted around 
80 km off Cadiz on its way to Galicia in north-
western Spain. 21 Bulgarian and 6 Colombian 
citizens were arrested in connection with the 
shipment. Cocaine trafficking towards the 
EU is strongly diversified, whereas Spain is a 
main entry point and distribution centre for 
cocaine from Latin America. According to Eu-
ropol, large amounts of cocaine are further-
more dispatched from Latin America through 
container vessels to the European ports of 
Antwerp and Rotterdam.
Criminal groups extensively smuggle Latin 
American cocaine to Europe via West Af-
rica, with Guinea Bissau and Ghana playing 
major roles as hubs.* From West Africa, the 
illicit load may transit along the coast and 
through the Maghreb towards Europe, or is 
taken by couriers on commercial flights to 
European airports.
Drugs smuggled across the Mediterranean 
Sea to enter the EU from the Balkans
Incidents in 2012 showed drug shipments that 
were trafficked across the Mediterranean Sea 
with the purpose to enter the EU through 
Bulgaria. In July 2012, Bulgarian law-enforce-
ment authorities seized 12 tonnes of hashish 
worth around EUR 360 million in a ware-
house in the village of Mirovyane near Sofia. 
National authorities claimed that the canna-
bis was brought from Morocco, unloaded in 
the Black Sea and transported to the main-
land by fishermen. The amount seized ex-
ceeded the detection of 4 tonnes of hashish 
destined for Belgium on a Danube ferry near 
Vidin few days before. The two cases were 
claimed to be connected. The Black Sea Bor-
ders are currently not covered by any Fron-
tex Joint Operation.
In May 2012, Bulgarian customs officers found 
67 kg of cocaine hidden in a combine har-
vester that was transported on successive 
ships from Argentina to the Black Sea city 
of Varna and from there to the Danube city 
of Ruse. The destination for the illicit sub-
stance was planned to be the Netherlands.

According to Europol, substantial seizures 
of cocaine, mostly in containers, have been 
made in Black Sea ports and in the Balkans, 
suggesting the development of these regions 
to important entry points for cocaine. Co-
caine is also increasingly directed towards 
Croatian ports.  
New synthetic drugs and their precursors 
smuggled on different routes mainly 
from Asia
The success of future anti-drug strategies will 
increasingly depend on the capacities to ef-
fectively identify a wide range of substances. 
The EU Early Warning System reports the 
detection of around one new toxic stimu-
lant per week, with a clearly rising tendency. 
All new drugs notified between January and 
September 2012 have been synthetic, with 
the largest groups being the synthetic cathi-
nones (e.g. mephedrone, MDPV), which show 
similar effects as cocaine, and the synthetic 
cannabinoids.* Most of the synthetic cathi-
nones are produced in China, India, Pakistan 
and other Asian countries, whereas amphet-
amine-type stimulants are manufactured in 
Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Japan, Lao PDR, 
Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Republic of 
Korea and Thailand.** 
In some cases, the traditional flow of illicit 
drugs into the EU may be reversed by in-
creased production of new ‘designer drugs’ 
in Central European countries, as well as of 
ecstasy and amphetamines in the Nether-
lands, Belgium, and Poland. Also in the Czech 
Republic, the police-led disruption of 400 
methamphetamine labs in 2012 revealed a 
clear export orientation of the illicit business.
Moreover, the number of products contain-
ing multiple psychoactive substances is on 
the rise, as also in the case of many ‘Legal 
Highs’, which are produced through chemi-
cal precursors mainly coming from China. The 
term is insofar misleading, as many of these 
drugs contain both controlled and uncon-
trolled substances. ‘Legal highs’ are popular 
among young consumers, as they are eas-
ily available through retail outlets and a ris-
ing number of internet stores. The impact of 
these drugs on the health of their consumers 
is enormous: 43 people died in the UK after 
taking licit methcathinones in 2010, com-
pared to 5 deaths in 2009. 
As the example of Hungary shows, the new 
trend towards ‘legal highs’ and a diversifica-
tion of synthetic drugs significantly changed 
the characteristics of the drug supply lines. 
Many new substances are produced domesti-
cally. While many of their online stores serve 
an international market, the precursors for 
the new synthetic drugs are ordered from 
China.***
3.10.2. Trafficking in human beings
In June, the European Commission adopted 
a new strategy for the years 2012–2016 for 
the eradication of Trafficking in Human Be-
ings. It announces key priorities in the fight 
against that crime, including the identi-
fication of victims, preventive measures, 
an increased prosecution of the perpetra-
tors, enhanced coordination and coopera-
tion among key actors, and the raising of 
public awareness. According to Europol, 
however, a large obstacle in the combat

against trafficking in human beings is the 
lack of harmonised and sufficient data on 
the phenomenon, which leads to a sig-
nificant intelligence gap. Assessments of 
national, international, and non-govern-
mental organisations are frequently based 
on incomplete data and estimates. In its 
Communication on measuring crime in 
the EU, the European Commission there-
fore adopted an Action Plan for 2011–2015 
to collect comparable and reliable data, 
based on a small number of indicators.*
The detection of persons trafficked for the 
purpose of sexual exploitation or forced la-
bour represents a major challenge for bor-
der authorities. Victims have to be identified 
as such although many of themselves not 
aware about their fate when they arrive in a 
transit or destination country. 2012 saw the 
further development of new ways to pre-
vent human trafficking. The key for a better 
recognition is the delivery of advance infor-
mation to border guards, which would sub-
stantially supplement the few seconds they 
normally possess for the identification of a 
potential victim among countless other pas-
sengers. Some airlines in the UK started to 
train cabin crews to identify potential perpe-
trators and victims of human trafficking al-
ready aboard the aircraft. A hotline has been 
established to communicate potential cases 
to border guards before planes arrive in the 
UK. A similar cooperation between the glo-
balised travel industry and national border 
authorities on a European level could expo-
nentially increase its outreach.
Research and law enforcement revelations 
related to human trafficking showed vari-
ous nuances of the phenomenon lately. In-
terviews with Nigerian victims in the UK 
conducted by the Institute for Public Policy 
Research suggest that most victims did not 
actively decide to take employment in the 
UK for an expectedly better life, but were 
compelled to leave their country by a par-
ent or close family member. The study also 
refutes the idea that Nigerian human traf-
ficking is run by organised crime groups in-
volved in drug smuggling and other crimes. 
Most of the trafficking was indeed informally 
arranged by the closest environment or the 
family of the victims. 
In contrast, other Member States high-
light the systematic division of work and 
high organisational level reached by Nige-
rian nationals involved in the trafficking of 
human beings, who operate nationally and 
across borders, applying a combination of 
modern managerial skills, traditional cul-
tural values and religious beliefs. In these 
cases, Nigerian criminal networks con-
ducting this crime should be seen as an 
aggregation of criminal groups with dif-
ferent tasks and specialisations, including 
the recruitment of the victims, the coun-
terfeit of documents, the transportation 
to the country of destination, the exploi-
tation of the victims and the laundering of 
profits. Some of these functional elements 
are also connected to other criminal activ-
ities. Migrants crossing the border illegally 
near the coast of Sicily, Calabria and Puglia, 
for example, are turned into trafficking vic-
tims by seizing their passport and forcing 
them to settle their fictive ‘debt’ through 
sexual or labour exploitation.

Some disruptions of Chinese criminal organ-
isations involved in large-scale human traf-
ficking activities, money laundering, and the 
smuggling of drugs and counterfeit products 
were reported in Spain and Italy.
The recently published UNODC Global Report 
on Trafficking in Human Beings 2012 described 
a particularly unsettling trend. According 
to its data collection and analysis, carried 
out in cooperation with national authorities, 
the number of trafficked children slightly in-
creased in Europe, accounting for around 16% 
the total during the reporting period. Many 
of these children were forced to beg or com-
mit petty crimes, others were trafficked for 
forced marriages, or forced participation in 
pornography. A frequent modus operandi re-
lated to trafficking of children has been seen 
by JO Indalo, when ‘anchor children’ were ac-
companied by Nigerian women on their way 
to Spain, who claimed to be their mothers. 
The parenthood, however, could be excluded 
by DNA test. The objective was to be granted 
with legal documentation that would allow 
free movement within the EU and to spon-
sor ‘family reunification’ with a ‘father’ still 
abroad. The women where forced into pros-
titution upon arrival in Spain, whereas a male 
migrant waiting in Morocco would claim to 
be the father and therefore be granted with 
the legal documents to follow.
While trafficking in human beings for labour 
exploitation is globally on the rise, this pur-
pose accounted for about 29% of all victims 
in Western and Central Europe, which is be-
low the international average. The stagnant 
European economy that followed the finan-
cial crisis boosted a low-cost labour market 
for mainly seasonal agricultural employment, 
which shows visible elements of coercion and 
deception. The International Labour Organ-
isation estimates that 1.5 million people are 
victims of forced labour in the developed econ-
omies, including cases resulting from prior 
trafficking. In 2007, the calculated opportu-
nity costs of coercion in terms of lost earn-
ings amounted to an estimated EUR 1.5 billion 
in the developed economies and EUR 15 bil-
lion globally.*
3.10.3. Terrorism
The terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, 
the August 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot in 
the UK and the 2009 Christmas Day Bomb-
ing attempt gradually shifted aviation-related 
security measures towards more stringency 
and comprehensiveness, but at the same time 
complicated the life of bona fide passengers 
and increased expenses for travel operators. 
A future strategy to further enhance security 
measures on commercial flights will have to 
emphasise on advance risk assessments and 
both the inter-agency and international ex-
change of information.
In 2012, the main EU decision-making bod-
ies were negotiating a Proposal for a Direc-
tive of the European Parliament and of the 
Council on the use of Passenger Name Re-
cord (PNR) data for the prevention, detection, 
investigation and prosecution of terrorist of-
fences and serious crime. The aim of the di-
rective would be to set up an EU system for 
the collection and use of PNR data, cover-
ing all flights across EU external borders. It 
would include information related to names, 
the date and the itinerary of the flight, and 
the means of payment used, among other 
things. Air carriers would transfer the data 
before departure of the flight to the law-en-
forcement authorities of the Member State 
it operates the flight from or to. The system 
allows border authorities to analyse the data 
and to compare it with existing files, as for ex-
ample related to terrorism. The data would be 
kept for 30 days, after which Member States 
would need to make it anonymous.
Recent cases show that efficient analytical 
capabilities in the identification of false docu-
ments are an essential tool of border author-

the US embassy in Ankara on 1 February 2013 
had crossed the EU external border from the 
Greek islands to Turkey with a false ID card. 
3.10.4. Smuggling of small weapons
The rather sporadic information received 
through Frontex Joint Operations and Mem-
ber State authorities on trafficking in small 
arms across the EU external borders does not 
give a comprehensive picture on the overall 
situation and leave a substantial knowledge 
gap. However, individual incidents suggest 
certain geographically related threats and 
vulnerabilities.
During JO Focal Points Land 2012, small fire 
arms, ammunition, and gun powder have 
been seized in 10 incidents, most of them at 
the borders to Croatia and Serbia.
Analysts from the Member States ex-
pect a continued flow of illicit small arms 
from the Western Balkan countries, where 
a large number of weapons are stored in 
private households. The influx of weapons 
from the Western Balkans to Central and 
Western Europe may increase after the ex-
pected EU accession of Croatia and the shift-
ing of the EU customs border to the long 
and mountainous area between Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
3.10.5. Stolen vehicles
According to Europol, the main destinations 
for stolen vehicles are: the Russian Federa-
tion, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Belarus, Ukraine, 
Pakistan and North Africa. This strongly influ-
ences the main routes for stolen vehicles and 
the composition of the OCGs, mostly made 
up of nationals from these regions.
The most concerned border section for the 
export of stolen vehicles in 2012 was  between 
Poland and Ukraine. In the course of JO Fo-
cal Points Land, 197 stolen cars, vans, lorries, 
trailers and motorbikes were identified e.g. 
through their vehicle identification numbers 
(VIN), with Volkswagen and Mercedes being 
the most popular brands. 
The second most important destination re-
gion for cars and other machinery stolen from 
mostly Germany, France and Italy were the 
Western Balkan countries. In the context of 
JO Focal Points Land, 83 cars were detected 
along the Slovenian-Croatian border. The 
export of 49 stolen vehicles was prevented 
at the border between Hungary and Serbia. 
The most popular targets for vehicle thefts 
destined for the Western Balkan countries 
were Volkswagen, BMW, and Audi.
A development away from the theft of luxury 
models towards a preference for cars of the 
medium and lower classes can be also seen 
in France, where in 2012 compact cars were 
among the models that were most stolen 
and frequently disassembled into spare parts. 
The prevalence for average-looking vehicles 
with standard colours definitely complicate 
the risk profiling efforts of border authorities.
JO Focal Points Land reported 41 stolen cars, 
lorries and motorbikes identified upon their 
attempted exit from Bulgaria and Greece 
to Turkey. Car thieves on the way to Turkey 
had exceptional preferences with an em-
phasis on luxury and sports cars, including 
the brands BMW (15) and Mercedes (8), Por-
sche (3), and Lamborghini (2). While most of 
the drivers were EU nationals or Turkish cit-
izens, some were from countries as far away 
as Iran, Egypt, Iraq, and Syria.
Another frequent destination of cars stolen 
in EU countries was Northern Africa: Fron-
tex officers in cooperation with national au-
thorities detected 42 stolen vehicles on their 
way to Morocco, of which 12 were identi-
fied at BCP Algeciras. Almost 1.2 million cars 
52 of 80
Frontex · annual risk analysis 2013 
pass through the port of Algeciras annually, 
arriving from or departing to Ceuta (Span-
ish enclave in Morocco) and Tangier (Mo-
rocco), and around 100 ships go in or out of 
the harbour daily. 
In five cases between July and August 2012, 
officers deployed through JO EPN Minerva 
2012 identified vehicles and a motorbike en-
gine arriving from Morocco at the Spanish 
BCPs of Algeciras, Ceuta, and Tarifa. The me-
dium-class vehicles of various brands were 
previously reported as stolen in France, It-
aly and Spain.
3.10.6. Smuggling of excise goods
The smuggling of tobacco is a lucrative ille-
gal activity due to increasing price differen-
tials between Member States of the EU and 
countries neighbouring its external borders.

external borders flourished in 2012 in face of 
rising excise taxes on tobacco in many EU 
countries. In general, cigarette smuggling is 
perceived as a low risk business, since in many 
countries it is treated as a misdemeanour – 
compared to the tough criminal sanctions 
imposed on drug traffickers. 
On a daily basis, cigarettes are smuggled 
on a small scale – by travellers or migrant 
workers returning home to the EU, or by per-
sons residing in the border regions. Criminal 
organisations make use of both ‘ant tech-
niques’ and large-scale operations includ-
ing hundreds of thousands of cigarettes. In 
2012, most detections of contraband ciga-
rettes were made along the borders to the 
Russian Federation, Belarus, Ukraine, Mol-
dova and Turkey.
In July, the cheapest pack of 20 cigarettes 
cost 41 cents in the Russian Federation, while 
Lithuanian citizens paid an amount five times 
and Finnish citizens ten times as high. Spe-
cifically, the situation around the Kaliningrad 
region was made worse by the fact that sev-
eral cigarette factories within the exclave 
solely produce for export purposes. The dif-
ficult economic situation in Kaliningrad and 
its neighbouring countries shapes an envi-
ronment that additionally encourages ciga-
rette smuggling. 
The largest smuggling operation that was 
uncovered in 2012 revealed a tunnel built 
between Uzhgorod in Ukraine and Vysne 
Nemecke in Slovakia. The smugglers used ad-
vanced mining technology to build the 700 
metres long construction and equipped it 
with its own narrow-gauge train.
A very frequent modus operandi detected dur-
ing JO Focal Points Land was to leave unat-
tended amounts of tobacco in trains, from 
where they are picked up upon arrival at their 
destination. Larger amounts of cigarettes 
have been hidden in hollow cavities of cars 
and double walls or floors of lorries. In several 
cases, cigarettes were smuggled across the 
river Uh, which originates in Ukraine and for a 
short section draws the border with Slovakia. 
While cigarettes where increasingly smug-
gled from Morocco to Spain and detected 
through JO Minerva and Indalo, also the East-
ern Mediterranean showed to be an emerging 
hub for trafficked tobacco. One of the larg-
est detections made in the context a Frontex 
Joint Operation consisted in the detection of 
around 53 760 000 Egyptian-produced ciga-
rettes on the vessel ‘Noah’ under Moldovan 
flag. The ship attracted the attention of the 
authorities in December 2012 close to Cha-
nia on the Greek island of Crete.

Trafficking of petroleum products is mainly 
reported at the eastern European borders 
with the Russian Federation, Belarus and 
Ukraine, as well as with the Balkan countries. 
Petrol price differentials between Member 
States and third countries made the smug-
gling of petrol a profitable enterprise along 
these border sections. Anecdotal evidence 
suggests that petrol smuggling occurs fre-
quently and often involves individual smug-
glers transporting smaller quantities for their 
own consumption or sale to acquaintances. 
55 of 80
Economic situation in Europe remains 
difficult 
The EU continues to deal with a difficult eco-
nomic crisis, which bears heavily on labour 
demand and employment performance in 
the EU. The differences between Member 
States in economic activity and labour mar-
ket dynamics have increased significantly 
throughout 2012. According to the Euro-
pean Commission, the already high unem-
ployment rate is likely to rise further in 2013, 
both in the EU and the Euro area. More im-
portantly, the situation in more vulnerable 
Member States will progressively affect the 
remainder of the EU. 
The EU economy is expected to grow at a 
subdued rate of 0.5% in 2013. However, the 
European Commission warns that this out-
look is still marked by high uncertainty and 
subject to substantial downside risks.
Home Affairs in the next MFF
According to the European Commission’s 
proposal, the number of funds in home af-
fairs during the new Multi-annual Financial 
Framework (period 2014–2020) will be re-
duced from the current four to only two: the 
Asylum and Migration Fund (AMF) and the 
Internal Security Fund (ISF). While the num-
ber of the funds will be smaller, the availa-
ble founding should increase by almost 40% 
compared to the total budget for the previ-
ous period 2007–2013.
Both funds will have an external dimension 
ensuring continuity of financing, starting in 
the EU and continuing in third countries. 
There will also be a common regulatory 
framework for both funds. 
The new arrangement should allow for a bet-
ter management, either shared or central-
ised, of available resources. Member States 
will be entitled to basic amounts and could

Implementation of Visa Information 
System (VIS)
The first phase of VIS implementation started 
already in October 2011 when consulates of 
all Member States (excluding the UK and Ire-
land) and Schengen Associated Countries in 
Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco 
and Tunisia began inserting biometric data of 
visa applicants into the VIS. Sweden was the 
first Member State with a registered trans-
action while Germany was the first to issue 
a visa with fingerprints.
By the end of 2011, the VIS had successfully 
processed almost 300 000 visa applications, 
of which roughly 33 500 visas were refused. 
A large majority of all fingerprints were sub-
mitted by only four Member States: France, 
Germany, Italy and Spain. The new system 
already detect almost 500 cases when the 
same person applied in more than one con-
sular post (potential visa shopping). 
By the end of 2012, the VIS was extended 
to cover two additional regions; the Middle 
East and the Gulf (Israel, Jordan, Lebanon 
and Syria, Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, 
Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United 
Arab Emirates and Yemen). The current plan 
is to extend the use of VIS to cover the whole 
globe by the end of 2013. 
The VIS should be considered as integral part 
of a future EU systems that will use advanced 
technology to strengthen controls and capac-
ity to monitor entries to the EU. Under cur-
rent plans it will be joined in coming years by 
an Entry-Exit System (EES) and Registered 
Traveller Programme as part of the ‘smart 
borders package’.
Schengen Information System II (SIS II) 
goes live in 2013
SIS II will have a number of new features com-
pared to the current Schengen Information 
System. These include the insertion of bio-
metric data into the system; interlinking of 
alerts on people and/or objects; and possible 
interoperability with other databases such as 
the Visa Information System (VIS).
Following the testing of the national and cen-
tral systems’ components, the focus of activ-
ity in the first half of 2012 was on intensive 
testing of the central system and its increas-
ing interaction with the national systems. 
The preparations for the final stages of the 
project, namely the actual migration of SIS I 
data, also advanced considerably during 2012.
According to the European Commission, all 
challenges encountered during these final 
testing phases of the project were addressed 
successfully, thanks to the over-riding cooper-
ative approach between Member States and 
the European Commission, allowing the SIS II 
project to go live in the first quarter of 2013.
SIS II will allow end users to have access to 
the extended functionality of SIS  II – ac-
cess to copies of the European Arrest War-
rant, links between alerts, new categories 
of alert, access to fingerprints and photo-
graphs of the subjects of alerts, enhanced

protection for the victims of misused iden-
tity, better opportunities for use of discreet 
check and specific check alerts due to clearer 
wording of the legal base, the opportunity 
to request seizure of property that is re-
quired as evidence (as opposed to being sim-
ply lost or stolen).
Member States’ national D-type visa 
policies show significant variation 
An in-depth study** of Member States’ use of 
long-stay (D-type) visas as a tool to manage 
migration, both in terms of facilitating legal 
migration and preventing irregular migra-
tion, revealed that a ‘mosaic of visa and res-
idence permit requirements exists in several 
Member States’.
Member States differ regarding:
n		The range of migratory purposes for which 
visas are issued (e.g. migration for study, 
employment, family reunification or hu-
manitarian purposes);
n		The target groups (e.g. third-country origin,

Road map for visa liberalisation with 
Kosovo*
Kosovo remains the only region in the West-
ern Balkans that is excluded from the visa-
free travel arrangements. At the end of 2011, 
the Council reaffirmed that Kosovo would 
benefit from the perspective of eventual visa 
liberalisation once all conditions are met and 
without prejudice to Member States’ posi-
tion on status.
Against this background, and taking into 
account the Council’s requirements ex-
pressed in various Council conclusions, as 
well as the result of numerous expert mis-
sions and meetings, the European Commis-
sion launched visa dialogue with Kosovo 
during January 2012.
The road map for visa liberalisation with Kos-
ovo was presented by the European Commis-
sion in June 2012. In this framework, Kosovo 
was requested first to adopt or amend the 
legislation in line with the EU acquis and as 
set out in the road map. Kosovo is also ex-
pected to fully implement the new legisla-
tion and all other measures specified in the 
road map document.
EU-Russian Federation visa 
liberalisation Common Steps
During 2012, the visa dialogue between the EU 
and the Russian Federation entered into imple-
mentation phase of the Common Steps which 
were agreed at the end of 2011. Field missions 
were implemented both by the EU and the 
Russian Federation. While the timetable lead-
ing to actual negotiations and to possible visa 
liberalisation is not known, a preliminary anal-
ysis on the impact shows that visa liberalisa-
tion would be a major institutional change at 
the eastern land borders of the EU. 
The operational environment would change 
significantly with the expected strong

growth of traffic at the EU-Russian Feder-
ation land borders. There is a lot of potential 
in foreign travel in the Russian Federation 
in general with large population base near 
the border. 
The growth of traffic in recent years at the 
Finnish-Russian land border (12 million in 2012, 
over +60% since 2009), partly due to use of 
the visa facilitation agreement, as well as 
recent figures from the Polish-Russian land 
border (+71.6% in 2012) suggest that the po-
tential for the growth of traffic in the condi-
tions of visa liberalisation is very large. 
Possible use of EURODAC data for law-
enforcement purposes
The European Commission’s proposal to 
recast the EURODAC Regulation will not 
change the fundamental way in which EU-
RODAC operates for the purpose of compar-
ing the fingerprints of asylum seekers and 
certain other categories of migrants in or-
der to facilitate the Dublin Regulation. The 
recast includes an extension to the scope 
of the Regulation in order to allow law-en-
forcement authorities in Member States as 
well as Europol to compare latent finger-
prints from crime scenes with EURODAC fin-
gerprint data for the purpose of preventing, 
detecting and investigating serious crimes 
and terrorism. 
The Agency for the Operational Manage-
ment of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of 
Freedom, Security and Justice  (EU-LISA) was 
established as anticipated and took up its re-
sponsibilities on 1 December 2012. The hand-
over of the operational management of the 
VIS is ongoing with a view to providing the 
full EU-LISA command on VIS management 
in the second quarter of 2013. The technical 
activities supporting the operational man-
agement have been carried out smoothly; 
with in particular the signature of the Main-
tenance in Working Conditions contract with 
an IT consortium at the end of 2012.
Update on EU readmission agreements
Readmission agreement with Pakistan is in 
force since 1 December 2010. The level of im-
plementation is quite weak. The first Joint Re-
admission Committee under the agreement 
was convened in June 2012. The next meet-
ing should be held in February 2013. 
The agreement with Turkey was initiated 
on 21 June 2012. The agreement is ready to 
be signed. 
The agreement with Cape Verde was initi-
ated on 24 April 2012. The agreement should 
be ready to be signed early 2013 once the 
Council grants its authorisation for the for-
mal signature on behalf of the EU. 
The negotiations on readmission agreement 
with Morocco are still stalled since 2010 and 
await the finalisation of the Mobility Part-
nership with Morocco. The negotiations with 
Belarus were not launched yet.
Readmission negotiations with Armenia 
have been completed (initialling of the Re-
admission Agreement took place on 18 Octo-
ber 2012) – now awaiting approval from the 
Council to sign the Agreement. Readmission 
negotiations with Azerbaijan are on the way 
– a fourth round is scheduled to take place 
in Brussels on 12 March 2013.
EUROSUR Directive – recent 
developments 
Frontex has run the EUROSUR pilot pro-
ject since 2010. All EUROSUR developments 
have been conducted in close collaboration 
with the European Commission and Member 
States. The EUROSUR Network has been in 
use since December 2011 and since March 2012 
the Network has been used to exchange op-
59 of 80
erational information. During 2012 the Net-
work was expanded from the original six 
Member States (Spain, France, Italy, Slova-
kia, Poland and Finland) to 18 (Portugal, Spain, 
France, Italy, Malta, Slovenia, Greece, Cy-
prus, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, 
Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland 
and Norway).
National Coordination Centres (NCCs) have 
been established in all these countries. The 
EUROSUR Directive is expected to enter into 
force as of 1st October 2013. By this date, the 
main pieces of the EUROSUR framework as 
well as the so called EUROSUR ‘basic ser-
vices’ should be available.

Based on the descriptions of the situation in 
2012 and a review of the main factors, be it 
economic, legal or technical, that can con-
tribute one way or another to irregular mi-
gration to the EU, this chapter reviews the 
possible evolution of the situation along the 
external border of the EU in the short-term. 
However, past experiences demonstrate that 
there are a large number of unforeseeable 
events and factors that can have a profound 
and unpredictable impact on the situation 
at the border.
5.1. Croatia joining the EU in 
July 2013
Accession negotiations with Croatia were 
closed in June 2011. After the European Com-
mission’s favourable opinion, the European 
Parliament’s assent and the Council deci-
sion on the admission of Croatia, the Acces-
sion Treaty was signed on 9 December 2011. 
Croatia has ratified the Accession Treaty 
and will become a Member of the EU on 1 
July 2013, subject to the Accession Treaty 
being ratified by all Members States. As 
an acceding country, Croatia has an active 
observer status during the interim period 
before accession. 
With Croatia joining the EU, the external land 
border of Member States of the EU will shift 
from the land border between Slovenia and 
Croatia (695 km) and Hungary and Croatia 
(355 km) to the land border between Croatia 
and Serbia (325 km), Croatia and Bosnia-Her-
zegovina (1 001 km) and Croatia and Mon-
tenegro (22 km), resulting in a net increase 
of 327 km. Combined, the borders between 
Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia and 
Montenegro total approximately 1 377 km. 
Therefore, Croatia will be the Member State 
with the longest external land border, slightly 
longer than Finland (1 340 km) and Greece 
(1 248 km).
The border section between Croatia and Bos-
nia-Herzegovina (1 001 km) will be the sec-
ond longest land border section, after the 
land border between Finland and the Russian 
Federation (1 340 km). This long border sec-
tion crosses very diverse terrain, from small 
mountain ranges to urban areas. 
Among all Croatian land border sections, the 
border between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzego-
vina will be one of the busiest EU land border 
sections in terms of regular traffic.
The main change in passenger flow across 
the external land borders of the EU will be 
the exclusion of the large flow of passen-
gers across the Slovenian-Croatian border. 
This is currently the land border section with 
the heaviest passenger traffic through BCPs, 
with 25 million entries in 2012.
The fact that Croatia is not yet joining the 
Schengen area and that border control will 
continue to operate between Croatia and Slo-
venia, is expected to have moderate impact 
on the main routes used by irregular migrants.

5. Outlook
61 of 80
5.2. Illegal border-crossing 
expected to remain concentrated 
at the  southern and south-
eastern borders of the EU
Based on the location of the main countries 
of origin for irregular migration to the EU for 
the past five years, the border areas that are 
most likely to deal with illegal border-crossing 
remain the Southern Mediterranean coast, 
and the borders with Turkey. Migrants living 
in or having relatively easy/facilitated access 
to Turkey and/or North Africa will continue 
to be overrepresented in the flow of irregu-
lar migrants to the EU.
The internet and social networking sites will 
contribute to the rapid exploitation of vulner-
abilities along the external border of the EU, 
allowing relatively cheap and non-sophisti-
cated illegal border-crossing. It is expected 
that illegal border-crossing along the green 
border, either at the land border or the sea 
border, will continue to significantly mobilise 
border-control authorities in the EU. 
5.3. Increase in passenger flows, 
in particular at the air border
Regular passenger flows across the exter-
nal border will increase significantly in the 
coming years due to rising global mobil-
ity, visa liberalisation processes and local 
border traffic agreements along the east-
ern borders. Consistent with the increas-
ing flow of passengers, a growing number 
of registered traveller programmes (RTP) 
should further ensure the smooth flow of 
bona fide passengers. 
An important strategy for efficiently process-
ing increasing passenger flows is the develop-
ment and deployment of Automated Border 
Checks. Such systems are being installed pro-
gressively in several Member States’ airports. 
Automated Border Checks uses the electronic 
information in the passport like facial or iris 
recognition technology to perform checks 
normally undertaken manually at the BCP. 
5.4. Increase in mixed 
migratory flows: asylum 
seekers and irregular migrants
The EU continues to receive a high num-
ber of refugees and asylum seekers. On the 
other hand, still a substantial number of eco-
nomic migrants appear to use the asylum 
procedure to try entering or staying on the 
territory of the EU.* The mixed nature of mi-
gratory flows contributes to placing the na-
tional asylum systems under pressure and 
the credibility of the asylum procedures un-
der strain. Therefore, while Member States 
are continuing their asylum system reforms, 
they increasingly call for the development at 
EU level of migration and refugee solutions 
in the regions of origin and transit.
The proposal for the so-called visa safeguard 
clause (amending Council Regulation (EC) No 
539/2001), that was originally presented by 
the European Commission in May 2011 in re-
sponse to growing abuse of asylum from the 
Western Balkans, is still not adopted.

6. Conclusions 
The assessment of risks along the EU exter-
nal borders shows that despite a sharp reduc-
tion in detections between 2011 and 2012, the 
risks associated with illegal border-crossing 
along the land and sea external borders re-
main among the highest, in particular in the 
southern part of the border of the EU. This 
is due to the current uncertainties related to 
the sustainability of the efforts at the Greek-
Turkish land border, combined with a contin-
ued volatile situation in traditional departing 
countries in Northern Africa and the Middle 
East. Resurgence of situations at the south-
ern border during which thousands of persons 
illegally cross the border in a few weeks or 
months remains likely. Past experiences also 
show that these crises take their toll on hu-
man lives, are very difficult to predict and to 
quell without coordinated responses. 
Most risks associated with document fraud 
were assessed as high. Indeed, document 
fraudsters not only undermine border security 
but also the internal security of the EU. These 
risks are also common to nearly all Member 
States, as they are associated with passen-
ger flow and border checks, a specific exper-
tise of border-control authorities. 
Most risks associated with abuse of legal 
channels are often assessed as high due to 
their high and widespread occurrence. Al-
though no reliable measurements exist, they 
probably represent the easiest and most com-
mon modus operandi for persons staying ille-
gally in the EU. 
Clandestine entry, mostly people hiding in 
vehicles, is assessed as moderate. However, 
uncertainties remain on the extent on the 
phenomenon, as there is no reliable meas-
urement in place. 
Based on currently available information, the 
risks associated with cross-border criminal-
ity are assessed as moderate, including the 
risks of trafficking in human beings, terror-
ism, smuggling of illicit drugs and exit of sto-
len vehicles. 
Border-control authorities may increase 
prevention by early detections only through 
strengthened border management resulting 
in increased coordination with other law-en-
forcement bodies.

Indicator 6 – Persons using false travel documents for entering the territory illegally: 
The number of persons who were detected by Member State authorities during border checks at BCPs who attempted 
to use false travel documents, false visas or false permissions to stay for the purpose of entering the territory. All cases 
of falsifications (forged, counterfeit, substitution of photo or name, fantasy documents, etc.) have to be included. The 
category concerns only those persons who used false passports, identity cards, residence or work permits, visas, etc., i.e. 
types of documents of which genuine versions would be valid for entering. Cases in which other types of documents have 
been used, such as false driving licences, false boarding passes or false supporting documents should not be included in 
this category. This indicator should include third-country nationals as well as EU and Schengen Associated Country (SAC) 
nationals.

third-country national was illegal and subject to an obligation to leave the territory of the Member State or 2) if a Member 
State makes use of the derogation provided for by Article 2(2) (b) of the Return Directive (e.g. the consequence of a return 
decision/order issued in accordance with national law). This indicator should not include EU nationals or third-country

Notes on FRAN data sources and 
methods
The term Member States refers to FRAN 
Member States, which includes the 27 Mem-
ber States and the three Schengen Associated 
Countries (Iceland, Norway and Switzerland). 
For the data concerning detections at the ex-
ternal borders of the EU, some of the border 
types are not applicable to all FRAN Mem-
ber States. This pertains to data on all FRAN 
indicators since the data are provided dis-
aggregated by border type. The definitions 
of detections at land borders are therefore 
not applicable (excluding borders with non-
Schengen principalities) for Belgium, the 
Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, 
Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the 
Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland 
and the UK. For Cyprus, the land border re-
fers to the Green Line demarcation with the 
area where the Government of the Repub-
lic of Cyprus does not exercise effective con-
trol. For sea borders, the definitions are not 
applicable for land-locked Member States 
including Austria, the Czech Republic, Hun-
gary, Luxembourg, Slovakia and Switzerland.
In addition, data on detections of illegal bor-
der-crossing at land, air and sea BCPs (1B) are 
not available for Iceland, Ireland and Spain, 
and in Greece these detections are included 
in the data for indicator  1A. Data for Nor-
way only include detections of illegal bor-
der-crossing at land and sea BCPs (1B), not 
between BCPs (1A).
In Italy, detections of illegal border-crossing 
at sea BCPs are only reported for intra-EU 
border-crossing from Greece. Data on de-
tections of illegal border-crossing between 
sea BCPs (1A) are not available for Ireland.
Data on apprehension (FRAN Indicator 2) of 
facilitators is not available for Ireland. For It-
aly, the data are not disaggregated by border 
type, but are reported as total apprehen-
sions (not specified). Data for Italy and Nor-
way also include the facilitation of illegal stay 
and work. For Romania, the data include 
land Intra-EU detections on exit at the bor-
der with Hungary.
For the data concerning detections of ille-
gal stay (FRAN Indicator 3), data on detec-
tions on exit are not available for Denmark, 
Ireland, Italy, Spain and the UK. For Greece, 
only detections of illegal stayers with false 
documents are reported at the air border as 
detections of illegal stay on exit.
Data on refusals of entry (FRAN Indicator 4) 
at the external EU borders are not disag-
gregated by reason of refusal for Ireland and 
the UK. Refusals of entry at the Spanish land 
borders at Ceuta and Melilla (without the is-
suance of a refusal form) are reported sepa-
rately and are not included in the presented 
FRAN data.
The data on applications for international 
protection (FRAN Indicator 5) are not dis-
aggregated by place of application (type of 
border on entry or inland applications) for 
Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovenia. For 
these countries, only the total number of ap-
plications is reported. For France, only asy-
lum applications at the external borders are 
reported, not inland applications. For Swit-
zerland, requests for asylum at the Swiss 
embassies abroad are also reported and con-
sidered as inland applications in the FRAN 
data. For the UK, data reported for applica-
tions at air BCPs also include applications at 
sea BCPs.
For Ireland, data on persons using false doc-
uments are only available from February 2011 
(FRAN Indicator 6). In Sweden, the data on 
false document use are not presented since 
the reported detections do not distinguish be-
tween apprehensions of persons using false 
documents at the external border and those 
apprehended inland.
