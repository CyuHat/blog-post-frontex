Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training, operations 
and research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. The Annual Risk Analysis and 
other risk analysis publications bear a triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a 
triangle, with a dot at the centre. Metaphorically, the arrow represents the cyclical nature 
of risk analysis processes and its orientation towards an appropriate operational response. 
The triangle is a symbol of ideal proportions and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit of 
factual exactness, truth and exhaustive analysis. The dot at the centre represents the 
intelligence factor and the focal point where information from diverse sources converges 
to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical products. Thus, Frontex risk analysis 
is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable basis for its operational activities.

The detections of illegal border-crossing 
along the external borders of EU Member 
States rose sharply from approximately 
104 000 in 2009 and 2010 to nearly 141 000 
in 2011 (+35%). The migrants crossing the 
borders illegally mainly came from Tunisia 
(20%), Afghanistan (16%) and Pakistan (11%). 
This increase is mostly due to the fact that 
more than 64 000 detections were re-
ported in the Central Mediterranean area, 
compared to only 5 000 in 2010. This surge 
was triggered by the change in the polit-
ical regime in Tunisia and later sustained 
by the departure of many sub-Saharan mi-
grants from Libya.
The second main area where illegal bor-
der-crossings were detected was the land 
border along the Eastern Mediterranean 
route, with over 55 000 detections, rep-
resenting a 12% increase compared to last 
year. At this border section, the number 
of detections increased steadily through-
out the year. In turn, migrants who ille-
gally crossed the external border in Greece 
tended to transit through the Western 
Balkans, or travel directly from Greece 
to Italy.
While the land border between Greece and 
Albania used to be one of the main entry 
points of irregular migration, the detec-
tions of illegal border-crossing reported 
at this border section dropped consider-
ably in 2011, from almost 35 300 to 5 270 
(-85%). This decrease follows the intro-
duction of a visa free regime for Albani-
ans as of 21 December 2010. It coincides 
with an increase in refusals of entry to 
Albanians at the Greek land border with 
Albania, the Italian sea border, and at UK 
air borders. Thus, Albanians ranked first 
in terms of refusals of entry issued in the 
EU as a whole, surpassing the number of 
Ukrainians refused entry.
Irregular migration pressure on the West-
ern Mediterranean route is now higher 
than it was in 2010, with slightly less than 
8 500 detections in 2011, which represented 
only 6% of the EU total. On this route, most 
of the migrants came from Algeria and Mo-
rocco, and the number of migrants from 
sub-Saharan countries increased.
The use of forged documents to enter the 
EU illegally continued to be of particular 
concern. The high level expertise needed 
to falsify modern documents means that 
false documents are increasingly linked to 
organised crime. The number of detections 
of travel document forgery used to en-
ter the EU was close to 9 500 in 2011, the 
highest level since systematic data collec-
tion began in Frontex in 2009. Apart from 
this increase, there are increased abuses 
of authentic documents by unauthorised 
users, known as imposters.
Within the EU, the total number of de-
tections of illegal stay remained stable 
between 2010 and 2011 at approximately 
350 000. As in the case of the reported 
number of detections of illegal border-
crossing, illegally staying Afghans and 
Tunisians also ranked among the top 
nationalities. 
Looking ahead, the border between Greece 
and Turkey is very likely to remain one of 
the areas with the highest number of de-
tections of illegal border-crossing along 
the external border. More and more mi-

grants are expected to take advantage of 
Turkish visa policies and the expansion of 
Turkish Airlines, carrying more passengers 
to more destinations, to transit through 
Turkish air borders and subsequently at-
tempt to enter the EU illegally.
At the southern maritime borders large 
flows are most likely to develop on the 
Central Mediterranean route due to its 
proximity to Tunisia, Libya and Egypt, 
where political instability and the high 
unemployment rates are pushing people 
abroad and where there is evidence of fa-
cilitation networks also offering facilita-
tion services to transiting migrants.
In response to increasingly sophisticated 
travel documents, there is an increase in 
the use of fraudulent supporting docu-
ments to obtain authentic travel doc-
uments. For example, facilitators are 
developing new techniques to circum-
vent biometric checks. This type of fraud 
not only enables illegal border-crossings 
but also affects internal security by al-
lowing undocumented migrants to as-
sume false identities. It is assumed that 
the number of detected document fraud-
sters increasingly under-represents the 
overall extent of the phenomenon, as the 
main focus at the national level is still on 
forged and counterfeit documents, rather 
than modi operandi involving false identi-
ties or impostors.
There is an increasing risk of political and 
humanitarian crises arising in third coun-
tries which may result in the displacement 
of large numbers of people in search of in-
ternational protection towards the land 
and sea borders of the EU.
The persistently large number of annual 
detections of illegal border-crossing along 
the external borders, oscillating between 
100 000 and 150 000 since 2008, has cre-
ated a market for criminal organisations 
facilitating the movement of illegal stay-
ers within the EU. There is an increasing 
risk that these secondary movements are 
adding to the pull factors for illegal cross-
ings of the EU external borders. 
Various austerity measures introduced 
throughout Member States may result in 
increasing disparities between Member 
States in their capacity to perform border 
controls and hence enable facilitators to se-
lect those border types and sections that 
are perceived as weaker in detecting spe-
cific modi operandi. Budget cuts could also 
exacerbate the problem of corruption, thus 
increasing the vulnerability to illegal activ-
ities across the external borders.
The increase in the number of air and land 
passengers and rising global mobility will 
increase the number of border checks. 
Visa liberalisation and local border-traf-
fic agreements are also being increasingly 
implemented or planned. As a result, the 
responsibilities and workloads of border-
control authorities are increasing.
As a corollary to strengthened surveillance 
and checks along the external borders, bor-
der-control authorities will be increasingly 
confronted with the detection of cross-
border criminal activities, such as traffick-
ing in human beings (THB), drug trafficking 
and the smuggling of excise goods, as well 
as cross-border crime committed on exit, 
such as the smuggling of stolen assets, 
particularly vehicles.

The Frontex Annual Risk Analysis (ARA) 
2012 has been developed to plan the coor-
dination of operational activities at the ex-
ternal borders of the EU in 2013. The ARA 
combines an assessment of threats and 
vulnerabilities at the EU external borders 
with an assessment of their impacts and 
consequences to enable the Agency to ef-
fectively balance and prioritise the alloca-
tion of resources against identified risks.
Frontex operational activities aim to 
strengthen border security by ensuring 
the coordination of Member States’ ac-
tions in the implementation of Community 
measures relating to the management of 
the external borders. The coordination of 
operational activities also contributes to 
better allocation of Member States’ re-
sources and protection of the area of free-
dom, security and justice.
The ARA 2012 concentrates on the current 
scope of Frontex operational activities, 
which is focussed on irregular migration 
at the external borders of the EU and the 
Schengen Associated Countries. Central 
to the concept of integrated border man-
agement, border management should also 
cover security threats present at the ex-
ternal borders. Hence, a section is devoted 
to the phenomenon of THB, the combat-
ing of which was tasked to Frontex pursu-
ant to the EU action plan (2005/C 311/01) 
on best practices, standards and proce-
dures for combating and preventing THB.
The Frontex Risk Analysis Unit would like 
to express its gratitude to all members of 
the Frontex Risk Analysis Network in Mem-
ber States for their efforts in providing data 
and information, as well as Europol, which 
has contributed to the ARA 2012, and all 
Frontex colleagues involved in the prepa-
ration of the report.
1. Introduction
Frontex · annual risk analysis 2012

Data collection plan
The backbone of the ARA 2012 are the 
monthly statistics provided by Member 
States within the framework of the Frontex 
Risk Analysis Network (FRAN). This regu-
lar data collection exercise was launched 
in September 2007 and refined in 2008. 
Thanks to the FRAN members’ efforts, 
a much larger statistical coverage was 
achieved in 2009, focussing on six key indi-
cators of irregular migration: (1) detections 
of illegal border-crossing, (2) refusals of en-
try, (3) detections of illegal stay, (4) asylum 
applications, (5) detections of facilitators, 
and (6) detections of forged documents.
Following the closing of the Centre for In-
formation, Discussion and Exchange on 
the Crossing of Frontiers and Immigra-
tion (CIREFI) working group in April 2010, 
most of its mandates, in particular those 
concerning the exchange of data were 
transferred to FRAN. Most indicators mon-
itored by CIREFI had already been part of 
the monthly data exchange among FRAN 
members and only the statistics on re-
turns had to be added as the seventh in-
dicator of the regular data collection as of 
January 2011.
The returns of third-country nationals ille-
gally entering or staying in Member States 
are an essential counter-measure under-
taken to control irregular migration. Re-
turn of third-country nationals to their 
country of origin is, to some extent, con-
sidered a measure of last resort in that it 
is only undertaken after other migration 
policy measures have failed and under cir-
cumstances where prior migration controls 
have proved ineffective or where resources 
have been overstretched. Moreover, expe-
rience has shown that efforts of Member 
States to return irregular migrants can be 
directly conducive to discouraging future 
migrant flows into and inside the EU.
For this analysis, only returns to third coun-
tries were considered, as opposed to those 
taking place between Member States. For 
this reason, the data may differ from the 
data released by Member States, as they 
often include returns between Member 
States.
Bi-monthly analytical reports and inci-
dent reports of Member States routinely 
collected within the FRAN and Member 
States’ contributions to several Tailored 
Risk Analyses produced in 2011 were both 
important sources of information, espe-
cially as regards the analysis of routes and 
modi operandi.
Open sources of information were also ef-
fectively exploited, especially in identifying 
the main push and pull factors for irregular 
migration to the EU. Among o thers, these 
sources included reports issued by govern-
ment agencies, international or non-gov-
ernmental organisations, as well as official 
EU reports, such as the Commission’s re-
ports on third countries, and mainstream 
news agencies.
In addition, Frontex organised an Annual 
Analytical Review to consolidate the risk 
analyses presented in the FRAN Quarter-
lies for 2011, and also to gather knowledge 
on likely risks of irregular migration ex-
pected in 2012 and 2013 at the EU external 
borders. Participants of the Frontex Risk 
Analysis Network were invited in Febru-
2. Methodology
7 of 60
ary 2012 to identify risks at the external 
borders during a one-day exercise, based 
on terms of reference and questions dis-
tributed in December 2011. After this exer-
cise, the participants were given one week 
to consult with colleagues at the national 
level to provide additional comments and 
rank the risks identified.
Data were collected by Frontex from na-
tional border-control authorities catego-
rised by border type (land, air and sea) and 
from land borders categorised by border 
section with neighbouring third countries.
The data collected by the FRAN are com-
piled and analysed on a quarterly basis. 
Member States’ data that are processed by 
Frontex are not treated as official statistics, 
and thus may occasionally vary from data 
officially published by national authorities.
Throughout 2011, some FRAN members 
performed backdated updates of their 2010 
statistics. These updates have been ac-
counted for in this document and so some 
data presented here may differ from the 
data presented in the 2011 Annual Risk 
Analysis.
External borders refer to the borders be-
tween Member States and third countries. 
The borders between the Schengen As-
sociated Countries (Norway, Iceland and 
Switzerland) and third countries are also 
considered as external borders. The bor-
ders between the Schengen Associated 
Countries and Schengen Member States 
are considered as internal borders. For the 
indicators on detections of facilitators, ille-
gal stay, and asylum, statistics are also re-
ported for detections at the land borders 
between the Schengen Member States 
and Schengen candidates (Bulgaria, Roma-
nia) or non-Schengen Member States (the 
UK, Ireland), so that a total for EU Mem-
ber States and the Schengen Associated 
Countries as a whole can be presented. It 
was not possible to make this distinction 
for air and sea borders because Member 
States do not habitually differentiate be-
tween extra-EU and intra-EU air and sea 
connections but tend to aggregate data 
for all arrivals.
In turn, Europol contributed to the ARA 
2012 by providing information on facili-
tated irregular migration.
Quality of available data
Consistent with other law-enforcement 
indicators, variation in administrative data 
related to border control depends on sev-
eral factors. In this case, the number of 
detections of illegal border-crossing and 
refusals of entry are both functions of the 
amount of effort spent detecting migrants 
and the flow of irregular migrants to the 
EU. For example, increased detections of 
illegal border-crossing might be due to an 
actual increase in the flow of irregular mi-
grants, or they may in fact be an outcome 
of more resources made available to de-
tect migrants. In exceptional cases, an in-
flux of resources may produce an increase 
in reported detections while effectively 
masking the actual decrease in the flow 
of migrants, resulting from a strong de-
terrent effect.
Conservative estimates of the number 
of irregular migrants within the EU vary 
between three and six million, accord-
ing to the latest results of Clandestino, an 
 EU-sponsored project implemented by the 
 ICMPD.* However, other estimates put the 
figure of irregular migrants at eight mil-
lion, of which 80% are staying inside the 
Schengen area, half of which having orig-
inally entered it legally. However, there is 
currently no estimate of the annual flow 
of irregular migrants crossing the bor-
der illegally.

Information on national-level resources for 
border-control authorities and their alloca-
tion is currently only partially known. These 
data are provided by Member States them-
selves either within the Schengen evalu-
ation mechanism or within the External 
Borders Fund reporting. Without system-
atic and reliable information on resources 
allocated to border control and without 
estimates of irregular migration flows, it 
is not possible to assess the performance 
and impact of the border controls put in 
place, and the analyses of the situation at 
the EU external borders are limited to de-
scriptive statistics of the administrative 
data provided by Member States.
As highlighted in the Schengen Cata-
logue, variation in regular passenger flow 
is an important factor to be taken into ac-
count in the allocation of border-control 
resources. However, regular flows of pas-
sengers across the EU external borders 
are currently not recorded systematically. 
Some approximations were arrived at by 
using available Eurostat data on passen-
ger flows at the air borders, and relying on 
publicly available data from national bor-
der-control authorities for passenger flows 
at the land borders.
Data on the number of EU visas issued and 
their places of issue would improve the 
characterisation of third-country passen-
ger flows. However, this information, which 
is collected within the Council Visa Work-
ing Party, is not yet available for 2011. For 
the purpose of the ARA, data from 2008 
to 2010 are discussed as an introduction to 
the general situation at the borders.
Application of the Common Integrated 
Risk Analysis Model (CIRAM)
A key development in the CIRAM update 
released in 2011 is the adoption of a man-
agement approach to risk analysis that 
defines risk as a function of threat, vul-
nerability and impact. Such an approach 
endeavours to reflect the spirit of the 
Schengen Borders Code and the Frontex 
Regulation, both of which emphasise risk 
analysis as a key tool in ensuring the op-
timal allocation of resources within con-
straints of budget, staff and efficiency of 
equipment.
According to the model, a ‘threat’ is a 
force or pressure acting upon the exter-
nal borders that is characterised by both 
its magnitude and likelihood; ‘vulnerabil-
ity’ is defined as the capacity of a system 
to mitigate the threat and ‘impact’ is de-
termined as the potential consequences of 
the threat. In this way, the structured and 
systematic breakdown of risk presented as 
conclusion, provides for an assessment of 
the relative overall risks posed by differ-
ent threats as a function of the relevant 
vulnerabilities and impacts, and therefore 
will be of much use to decision-makers 
in setting priorities, in formulating coun-
ter-measures and in designating opera-
tional targets.

3.1.  Border controls (visas 
and passenger flows)
Visa
The Community Code on Visas, which en-
tered into force in April 2010, sets out the 
common requirements for issuing transit 
and short-term visas to enter the terri-
tory of Member States.* There are cur-
rently over 100 nationalities that require 
a visa to enter the EU, covering more than 
80% of non-EU population of the world. 
About one billion nationals from approx-
imately 40 third countries do not require 
an EU visa. As indicated in the Visa Code, 
statistical data are an important means of 
monitoring migratory movements and can 
serve as an efficient management tool.**
Generally, a short-stay visa issued by one 
of the Schengen States (visa C) entitles its 
holder to travel throughout the 26 Schen-
gen States for up to three months within a 
six-month period. Visas for visits exceed-
ing that period remain subject to national 
procedures. Data for 2011 are not yet avail-
able, but the Commission, through its DG 
Home Affairs has released the data for 
2010, which showed that slightly more than 
11.8 million visas (all types) have been issued 
by Schengen and non-Schengen Member 
States (Bulgaria, Romania, yet not the UK 
or Ireland). This represented an increase of 
about 16% compared to the previous year.
In 2010, as it has been the case since 2007, 
most short-stay visas were issued in the 
Russian Federation (4 466 253), where the 
number increased by 28% between 2009 
and 2010. Ukraine followed with slightly 
more than one million visas issued in 2010 
(+18% compared to 2009). China, in the 
third place with 784 000, saw the number 
of visas issued rising by 40% between 2009 
and 2010.
The number of issued short-stay visas 
(visa  C) varied across Member States, 
from 1.77 million issued by France to 549 is-
sued by Iceland. The visa rejection rate, 
calculated as the ratio of the number of 
not-issued visas to the total number of 
applications, also varied, from 19% in Bel-
gium (40 017 rejections for 215 978 appli-
cations) to 1% in Bulgaria (6 249 rejections 
for 599 026 applications).
Passenger flow
Passenger flow is an indicator of the vol-
ume of checks that border guards have 
to perform. Citizens enjoying free move-
ment are subject to minimum checks, while 
third-country nationals, whether they re-
quire visas or not, will be subject to more 
thorough checks, as defined by the Schen-
gen Borders Code. Hence, the nature and 
extent of passenger flow are important 
for planning resources for border checks.
At the European level there is no estimate 
of total passenger flows through the EU 
external borders. However, a one-week 
counting exercise conducted by the Council 
in 2009 (excluding the UK and Ireland) leads 
to two main conclusions: (1) EU citizens ac-
count for 72% of regular flow, and (2) land 
and air border flows are much larger than 
flows through maritime borders.
At the external land borders of the EU, al-
though there is not systematic collection 
of passenger flow data at the EU level, the

Point 19 of recitals
11 of 60
busiest border section for entries of pas-
sengers is probably the border between 
Slovenia and Croatia, with approximately 
23 million annual entries. The land border 
between Spain and Morocco is also a very 
busy border section, totalling more than 
10 million annual entries (for both Ceuta 
and Melilla). The land border between Po-
land and Ukraine, with approximately seven 
million passengers annually, also belongs 
to the busiest land border sections.
Along the eastern land border, stretching 
for more than 4 000 km from Romania to 
Finland, one recurring pattern is the strong 
seasonality of regular passenger flow, with 
most of the crossings (entry/exit) taking 
place during the summer months. This re-
quires an optimal mobilisation of resources 
during this period to avoid undue waiting 
time for bona fide travellers. This is also the 
case at the Greek and Bulgarian land bor-
ders with Turkey. By contrast, the summer 
increase in passenger flow is smaller at the 
Slovenian border with Croatia.
At the air borders, Eurostat reported a to-
tal of 107 million arrivals on flights origi-
nating outside the EU in 2010, which was 
an increase by 10% compared to 2009. The 
largest numbers of arrivals are reported 
from the airport of London Heathrow with 
approximately 17 million passengers each 
year, followed by Paris-Charles De Gaulle 
airport (13 million) and Frankfurt airport 
(11 million). Other EU airports reported less 
than 10 million arrivals in 2010.
For 2011, according to a preliminary report 
issued by Eurostat in October 2011*, the 
level of air passenger flow confirms the 
overall upward trend observed in 2010. 
Particularly remarkable is the growth of 
air passenger flow in Estonia (+37%) and 
Luxembourg (+25%). The decline observed 
in total air passenger flow was most pro-
nounced for Greece (-14% between 2010 
and 2011 for the first quarter of the year), 
especially marked by the effect of the crisis. 
Outside the EU-27, Turkey reported a re-
markable increase of 26% in passenger flow.
3.2. Irregular migration
There were major and extensive develop-
ments in irregular migration pressure at 
the external border of the EU in 2011, re-
sulting, on the one hand, from the increase 
in detections of illegal border-crossing in 
the Mediterranean following the situation 
in North Africa and, on the other, from the 
decrease in detections of Albanians illegally 
crossing the green border with Greece fol-
lowing the visa liberalisation.
At the EU level, the total number of detec-
tions of illegal border-crossing increased 
from 104 000 in 2010 to 141 000 in 2011 
(+35%). The migration pressure at the ex-
ternal border increased even more than 
EU-level figures suggest, as they were off-
set by extensive reductions in Albanian cir-
cular migration.
Consistent with recent trends, the majority 
of detections were made in two hotspots 
of irregular migration, namely the Cen-
tral Mediterranean area and the Eastern 
Mediterranean area accounting for 46% 
and 40% of the EU total, respectively, with 
additional effects detectable across Mem-
ber States.
Most reported detections of illegal border-
crossing involved Tunisians (28 829 detec-
tions) arriving by the Central Mediterranean 
route at the beginning of 2011. Afghans 
ranked second with just under 23 000 de-
tections, mostly reported on the Eastern 
Mediterranean route. Detections of Paki-
stanis increased significantly and steadily 
throughout 2011, from less than 4 000 in 
2010 to more than 15 300 in 2011, mostly 
on the Eastern Mediterranean route.

Detections of illegal stay remained rela-
tively stable between 2010 (353 100) and 
2011 (350 900), the majority of which were 
reported in the same three Member States 
as in previous years, i.e. Spain, France and 
Italy, together accounting for 36% of all de-
tections. However, detections of illegal stay 
significantly increased in Germany, Aus-
tria and Switzerland. In these three Mem-
ber States, the most detected nationality 
were Afghans, rising from approximately 
4 300 detections in 2010 to more than 
7 300  in 2011. Most of them had illegally 
crossed the border on the Eastern Medi-
terranean route. Detections of illegal stay 
significantly decreased in Greece, mostly 
due to fewer detections of illegally stay-
ing Albanians after visa liberalisation was 
introduced for this nationality.
In contrast to the increase in detections of 
illegal border-crossing and the stable de-
tections of illegal stay, there were fewer 
detections of facilitators of irregular mi-
gration than ever before, totalling below 
7 000. Much of the decline was due to a 
lower number of detected facilitators re-
ported in Italy in 2011 in comparison to 2012. 
Detections of facilitators also decreased in 
Greece, corresponding to the decrease in 
facilitation required for illegal border-cross-
ing along the border with Albania, as well 
as more stringent sanctions against facil-
itators. By contrast, detections of facili-
tators increased in France, mostly due to 
larger detections of Tunisian facilitators in 
the wake of the large flow of migrants ar-
riving by the Central Mediterranean route, 
and also in Switzerland. In the latter coun-
try the increase in detections of facilita-
tors, corresponded to a two-fold increase 
in detections of illegal stay.
As regards effective returns to third coun-
tries, in 2011, Member States reported a 
total of slightly above 148 000 returned 
migrants. The comparison with previous 
year is not available due to limited re-
porting in 2010. The UK reported most of 
the effective returns, followed by Greece. 
Most of the migrants returned to third 
countries were Albanians. They were fol-
lowed by Tunisians, mostly returned by It-
aly and France (7 800 in total for the two 
Member States).
Due to the difficulties in implementing the 
return agreement with Turkey, most of the 
orders to return migrants who had ille-
gally crossed the border with Turkey could 
not be implemented. For example, there 
were a total of 21 542 return orders issued 
for Afghans in Greece, but only 745 effec-
tive returns.
3.2.1. Irregular migration routes
Following the waves of illegal border-
crossing from North Africa in the first half 
of 2011, the Central Mediterranean route 
recorded the largest number of detections. 
As illustrated in Table 2 overleaf, the second 
greatest number of illegal border-cross-
ings was reported on the Eastern Med-
iterranean route, where detections were 
more sustained through the year than on

the Central Mediterranean route. Circu-
lar migration between Albania and Greece 
considerably reduced, while the Western 
Mediterranean route showed signs of in-
crease in the second half of 2011. Along 
the eastern land borders, detections of il-
legal border-crossing were low. Figure 1 
presents a statistical overview of the de-
tections of illegal border-crossing by route 
and quarter.
Central Mediterranean route
In the Central Mediterranean area, Mem-
ber States reported a total of 64 000 de-
tections, compared to only 5 000 in 2010. 
Most of the illegal border-crossings oc-
curred between February and August 2011, 
which represented one of the largest num-
bers of detections in a single area over such 
a short period of time (seven months). By 
comparison, detections in the same area 
for the whole of 2008, the previous peak 
year, totalled less than 50 000.
Initially, detections in the Central Mediter-
ranean massively increased in early 2011, due 
to civil unrest erupting in the region, par-
ticularly in Tunisia, Libya and, to a lesser ex-
tent, Egypt. As a result, between January and 
March some 20 000 Tunisian migrants ar-
rived on the Italian island of Lampedusa. In 
the second quarter of 2011 the flow of Tuni-
sian migrants was reduced by 75% follow-
ing an accelerated repatriation agreement 
that was signed between Italy and Tuni-
sia. However, large numbers of sub-Saha-
ran migrants were detected in Lampedusa, 
Sicily and Malta, many having been forci-
bly expelled from Libya by the Gaddafi re-

gime. Since October 2011, the situation has 
eased somewhat due to democratic elec-
tions in Tunisia and the National Transi-
tional Council successfully gaining control 
of Libya. However, the situation remains of 
concern, with sporadic arrivals from Tuni-
sia now adding to arrivals from Egypt. There 
are also some concerns that the flow from 
Libya may resume.
The flows of migrants arriving in the EU 
have had an effect on the number of ap-
plications for international protection. At 
the EU level, the number of Tunisians de-
tected illegally crossing the border to-
talled nearly 29 000  in 2011 (see Fig.  2), 
whereas the number of applications for 
international protection reported through 
the Frontex Risk Analysis Network was 
7 100. The flow of Tunisian migrants who 
crossed the border illegally appeared to be 
mostly economically-driven, with most 
migrants heading to France as their fi-
nal destination.
The large number of detections of Tunisians 
crossing the external border illegally in 2011 
was matched by a significant increase in de-
tections of illegally staying Tunisians over 
the last year. Such detections increased 
from under 8 500 in 2010 to more than 
22 500 in 2011, with Tunisian illegal stay-
ers mostly reported in France.
In 2011, approximately 8 600 Tunisians were 
returned (this number does not include re-
turns within the EU), mostly by Italy and 
France.
Eastern Mediterranean route
Detections of illegal border-crossing on 
the Eastern Mediterranean route (57 000) 
have followed a remarkably seasonal pat-
tern, invariably peaking in the third quar-
ter of each year and concentrated at the 
Greek border with Turkey with a shift from 
the sea border to the land border in early 
2010. The five most commonly detected

Figure 3: Main areas of detections of illegal border-crossing in 2011
17 of 60
nationalities were from Asia (Afghan, Pa-
kistani, Bangladeshi) and North Africa (Al-
gerian and Moroccan).
The most commonly detected migrants 
were Afghans, who were the second most 
represented nationality detected crossing 
the external border illegally in 2011, repre-
senting 16% of the EU total. Information 
collected during interviews conducted dur-
ing JO Poseidon Land 2011 suggests that 
more than 60% of Afghan migrants ap-
prehended in Greece were actually resid-
ing (either legally or illegally) as refugees in 
Iran prior to their attempt to enter the EU.
At this border section detections of mi-
grants from Pakistan increased massively 
compared to the previous year and ranked 
third in the EU total with 15 377 detections. 
Intelligence suggests that most Pakistani 
migrants are young male and previously 
unemployed economic migrants from 
northeastern Pakistan. They travel over-
land to Greece often with the help of facili-
tators and are holding false documentation. 
The main destinations claimed by the Pa-
kistani migrants who were interviewed 
were Greece, followed by Germany, Bel-
gium, Italy, the UK and France.
Small numbers of nationals claiming to be 
from Iraq, Turkey, Palestine and Syria at-
tempted to enter Bulgaria illegally, but no 
significant displacement in the irregular mi-
gratory flow towards the Bulgarian-Turk-
ish land border was observed. 
Detections at the sea border between 
Greece and Turkey have declined signifi-
cantly in the last two years. The decline 
at this previous hotspot is confirmed by 
data collected during JO Poseidon Sea but 
stands in contrast to the significant number 
of illegal border-crossings detected at the 
land border between Greece and Turkey, 
the associated increase in illegal border-
crossings across the southern Italian blue 
border, and the attempts of clandestine 
entry on ferries arriving in southern Italy 
from Greece.
Undeniably, the land border between 
Greece and Turkey is now an established il-
legal-entry point for irregular migrants and 
facilitation networks. Secondary move-
ments from this hotspot of migration are 
readily detected at the land borders be-
tween the Western Balkans and both Slov-
enia and Hungary, at the blue border of 
southern Italy and at a range of European 
airports, particularly in final destination 
countries such as the Netherlands, Bel-
gium and Germany. Secondary movements 
can thus be classified into two categories: 
secondary movements affecting other sec-
tions of the external border, namely the 
Western Balkans, and secondary move-
ments affecting flows of migrants illegally 
staying in the EU (intra-EU).
Secondary movements through the West-
ern Balkans are discussed in a dedicated 
section below. As regards intra-EU move-
ments many migrants transit through 
Greece via the intra-Schengen air bor-
der using fraudulent documents. They 
mainly use French or Greek ID-cards or 
passports encompassing a wide range of 
fraud: forged (photo substitution), coun-
terfeit and genuine documents (impost-
ers). Small EU airports are often targeted, 
either as departure or arrival points, for 
example from Athens to Brussels South 
Charleroi in Belgium, or Thessaloniki and 
Heraklion in Greece to German destina-
tions. In Germany, a large proportion of 
asylum applications were filed by passen-
gers on intra-Schengen flights arrived from 
Greek airports.

Circular migration from Albania to 
Greece
Since being granted visa-free travel to the 
EU in late 2010, Albanians have been de-
tected crossing the border illegally in much 
lower numbers. However, reports suggest 
that Albanians are still circular migrants to 
Greece, but this legal flow is now routed 
through land BCPs. In support of this, Al-
banians are now refused entry to Greece 
in large numbers, mostly due to an exist-
ing alert in the Visa Information System. It 
is assumed that in many cases, the alerts 
have been created following a previous at-
tempt, before visa liberalisation, to cross 
the border illegally. In addition, other move-
ments are now reflected in refusals of en-
try to Italy and Slovenia.
The reduction in illegal border-crossings 
has allowed Albanian border-control au-
thorities to refocus some of their surveil-
lance efforts on other cross-border criminal 
activities, resulting in significantly in-
creased cannabis seizures.
The broadening of legal travel options has 
reduced substantially the number of de-
tected Albanians staying illegally in Greece.
By contrast, detections of Albanians ille-
gally staying increased in several other 
Member States such as France, the UK, 
Belgium, Germany and Sweden.
Western Mediterranean route (sea, 
Ceuta and Melilla)
Irregular migration across the Western 
Mediterranean towards southern Spain 
was at a low level through most of 2010. 
However, pressure has been steadily in-
creasing throughout 2011 to reach almost 
8 500 detections, or 6% of the EU total. A 
wide range of migrants from North African 
and sub-Saharan countries were increas-
ingly detected in this region. It is difficult 
to analyse the exact composition of the 
flow, as the number of migrants of un-
known nationality on this route doubled 
compared to the previous quarter. This 
may indicate an increasing proportion of 
nationalities that are of very similar eth-
nicity and/or geographic origin.
The most common and increasingly de-
tected were migrants of unknown na-
tionality, followed by migrants local to 
the region, coming from Algeria and Mo-
rocco. There were also significant increases 
in migrants departing from further afield, 
namely countries such as Côte d’Ivoire, 
Guinea, Nigeria and Congo.
In 2011, two boats were intercepted in the 
waters of the Balearic Islands with Alge-
rians on board, having departed from the 
village of Dellys (Algeria) near Algiers. How-
ever, most migrants prefer to target the 
southern coast of the Iberian Peninsula.
Western African route
The cooperation between Spain and key 
western African countries (Mauritania, 
Senegal and Mali), including bilateral agree-
ments, is developing. They are one of the 
main reasons for the decrease in arrivals 
on the Western African route over the last 
years, as is the presence of patrolling as-
sets near the African coast. Despite a slight 
increase at the end of 2010, detections on 
this route remained low in 2011, almost 
exclusively involving Moroccan migrants.

In January 2011 the United Nations Office 
on Drugs and Crime published a report on 
the role of organised crime groups in facil-
itating irregular migration from West Af-
rica to the EU. The report was generated 
by desk and field research (interviews) and 
concludes with four main findings, which 
are consistent with the findings of the 
Frontex Risk Analysis Network:
1.  West Africans are facilitated by loose 
networks with no permanent structure;
2.  Within West Africa, freedom of move-
ment gives little incentive to engage in 
smuggling of migrants;
3.  In West Africa, most smugglers are mi-
grants themselves, passing on their own 
experiences;
4.  In some West African countries, impor-
tant social value is attached to those 
who decide to leave and also to those 
who have successfully made it to Europe, 
be it legally or illegally, even though their 
situation in Europe is often worse than 
it was at home.
Western Balkan route
Apart from Albanian circular migration, 
the Western Balkans route remained 
largely a function of the transiting flow of 
migrants that enter the EU at the Greek-
Turkish borders and later continue to-
wards other Member States through the 
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, 
Serbia and Croatia. Migrants travelling 
within the EU from Greece and further 
on to other destination Member States 
usually use the fastest possible route to 
re-enter the Schengen area (Hungary or 
Slovenia).
The Slovenian authorities reported an in-
crease in detections of Afghans and Pa-
kistanis who, having claimed asylum in 
Croatia, tried to illegally enter the EU. The 
increase was significant enough for the 
Slovenian Ministry of Interior to issue a 
public warning calling upon citizens to re-
port sightings of irregular migrants.
In 2011, detections at the Romanian bor-
der with Serbia surpassed those at the 
Slovenian border with Croatia. Migrants 
were mostly detected close to the bor-
der area between Serbia, Romania and 
Hungary, which should be considered as 
a displacement from the main Serbian-
Hungarian route, where additional meas-
ures by Serbian and Hungarian authorities 
made it more difficult to cross the bor-
der illegally.
Consistent with detections at the land bor-
der between Greece and Turkey, the most 
detected nationalities were Afghan and Pa-
kistani. Arabic-speaking migrants were also 
detected in large numbers.
With more than 21 000 asylum applica-
tions submitted in 2011 in the EU, the asylum 
abuse by the five visa-exempt national-
ities of the Western Balkans, mostly na-
tionals of Serbia and the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia, remained a signif-
icant problem in 2011. However, compared 
to 2010, the lower number of applications 
filed in 2011 is a sign of a decreasing trend 
of this phenomenon.
Eastern European route
The route running through eastern land 
borders is reflected in detections of ille-
gal border-crossing reported by Lithuania, 
Slovakia, Romania, Hungary, Poland, Esto-
nia, Finland and Latvia. Despite the length 
of the total border section, the number of 
detections of illegal border-crossing tends 
to be lower than on other routes, totalling 
approximately 1 000 detections in 2011.
Reports from Belarus and EU Member States 
suggest that there are increasing numbers 
of migrants from Georgia arriving in Belarus

with the intention of illegally entering the 
EU. Many arrived by air but others were de-
tected transiting Ukraine and Armenia. This 
migration flow is also reflected by increased 
presence of Georgians in migration indica-
tors in several Member States such as illegal 
border-crossing (Poland, Lithuania), second-
ary movements (Estonia) and applications 
for asylum (Latvia, Poland). 
Also relevant for the Baltic area in 2011, par-
ticularly Latvia and Estonia, are reports of 
irregular migrants from sub-Saharan coun-
tries being increasingly detected. For ex-
ample, there was a growing number of 
migrants from the Democratic Republic of 
Congo detected in Latvia and heading for 
Finland as their destination country. These 
migrants first travelled to the Russian Fed-
eration by air and later tried to enter the 
EU using falsified documents, often Belgian 
residence permits.
Air routes
In 2011, the external air borders of the EU 
continued to be characterised by large pas-
senger flows, a large share of refusals of 
entry and a substantial number of detec-
tions of forged documents. As regards bor-
der controls, the most significant increases 
were observed in refusals of entry to Alba-
nian nationals following visa liberalisation at 
the end of 2010, and an almost 20% rise in 
applications for asylum made directly at the 
air border in relation to the previous year.
Refusals of entry at the air borders re-
mained stable at about 49 000. Brazil-
ians still ranked first on this indicator, even 
though their number has been decreas-
ing since 2008, totalling 4 700 refusals in 
2011, compared to 6 000 in 2010. Albani-
ans became the second most often refused 
nationality, jumping from 624 refusals of 
entry in 2010 to slightly more than 3 300 in 
2011. Albanians were mostly refused entry 
at Italian and Belgian airports, for the rea-
son of an alert in the Schengen Information 
System or in national register (represent-
ing 40% of the cases at Italian airports), or 
for not possessing enough documentation 
justifying the purpose of stay. The map on 
the next page (see Fig. 4) shows the areas 
along the external borders reporting the 
largest number of refusals of entry.
Compared to 2010, applications for asylum 
filed at the air borders in 2011 increased by 
almost 20% to reach approximately 12 000, 
or 5% of the EU total. Similarly to the previ-
ous year, most of the applications were filed 
by Iranians and Afghans. The most conspic-
uous increase in 2011 was reported for ap-
plications filed by Syrians, which totalled 
over 700 compared to under 300 in 2010.
3.2.2. Modus operandi
Illegal border-crossing of the land 
borders
The main characteristic in this modus oper-
andi is for migrants to cross on foot in small 
groups, usually at night. Increasingly, the fa-
cilitators would not cross the border them-
selves but leave the migrants close to the 
border with instructions on how to cross 
and how to behave and continue their jour-
ney once on the other side of the border.
There were several reports indicating that 
migrants would take advantage of the 
change of border guards’ shifts to attempt 
crossing the border. However, there is no 
systematic data collection in place confirm-
ing these reports.
Information collected during Frontex Joint 
Operations suggests that migrants travel 
to the Greek-Turkish land border in order 
to cross the River Evros at night in small 
groups. They use small-size inflatable boats 
propelled by oars.
Frontex · annual risk analysis 2012 
22 of 60
The geographical analysis of data collected 
during Frontex Joint Operations confirmed 
that the illegal crossing usually took place 
relatively close to the road networks on 
the two sides of the border. On the third-
country side, the road connection enabled 
facilitators to easily drop off migrants at a 
minimum cost and time, while on the Mem-
ber State side, the proximity of a road al-
lowed migrants to continue their journey 
further into the EU on their own or be eas-
ily picked up by facilitators.
Individual land border-crossings were rare. 
The size of groups varied from a few indi-
viduals to large groups of about 50 (and 
more in exceptional cases). Detections usu-
ally took place right after the crossing. In 
general, migrants did not attempt to es-
cape or avoid apprehension.
There is no data or estimates of the number 
of migrants crossing the green border un-
detected, but it is assumed to be rather low. 
Travelling undocumented and false state-
ment of nationality as part of overall 
modus operandi
Many migrants opt to cross the green or 
blue border undocumented, so as to make 
it more difficult to determine their actual 
country of origin. Similarly, false statements 
about their nationality can also be consid-
ered as part of the modus operandi of ille-
gal border-crossing. This is particularly the 
case for migrants from those third coun-
tries with which readmission agreements 
exist and are implemented.
Applying for asylum as part of overall 
modus operandi
Several Member States reported cases of 
migrants who had entered the EU illegally, 
attempting to reach their final destination, 
often in a western European Member State, 
and claiming asylum only if apprehended 
by border guards or other law-enforce-
ment authorities. 
Some Member States reported that once 
they had registered in an asylum centre, 
many migrants absconded only a few days 
later, continuing their journey to their in-
tended final destination. This was partic-
ularly the case for Serbians and Afghans 
detected at the border between Hungary 
and Serbia.
Illegal border-crossing of the blue 
border
In 2011, most of the migrants illegally cross-
ing the external borders in the Mediter-
ranean Sea were detected on Tunisian 
wooden fishing boats, but migrants are 
diversifying their methods, as illustrated by 
the wide variety of vessels detected in 2011 
during Frontex Joint Operations.
One detected group of migrants paid 
EUR 2 000 to buy a 4 m traditional fishing 
boat equipped with fuel, cigarettes, bread 
and water, and a 15 hp outboard engine 
(see Fig. 5). They left Skhira in Tunisia pay-
ing a local skipper to tow them to open 
waters. They were given a compass and a 
GPS device and were cut loose after three 
to four hours.

In April 2011 a 22 m vessel departed from 
Libya and was detected near Lampedusa 
carrying some 760 migrants mostly nationals 
of North and Central African countries. In-
telligence suggests that such migrants had 
generally been residents of Libya for up to 
a year before being forcibly expelled in this 
way (see Fig. 6).
Some migrants use toy inflatable boats, of-
ten with no engine to get to Spain across 
the Strait of Gibraltar (see Fig. 7). Those 
small and unstable boats usually carry two 
or three people (in case of Moroccan would-
be migrants) but in the case of sub-Saharan 
migrants they have been detected carrying 
up to ten people. For instance, as many as 
32 sub-Saharan migrants were rescued near 
Melilla onboard four toy inflatable boats 
on the early morning of 29 June 2011. They 
had left the Moroccan coast (Tres Forcas 
Cape area) for a short trip to Spanish wa-
ters of north of Melilla. This modus operandi 
appears to be replacing that of departing 
from Tres Forcas Cape hidden in Moroccan 
fishing boats and then jumping off the ves-
sel to reach the Spanish shore swimming.
In the case of Ceuta, local geographical fea-
tures even allow for swimming as a method 
of illegal entry (see Fig. 8).
A 13 m sailing boat registered in the Port 
of Piraeus (Greece) was detected in Puglia 
(Italy) carrying 35 irregular migrants. Apart 
from speed boats, such high quality pleas-
ure boats are typically used for secondary 
movements from Greece to Italy. They are 
also used for a direct crossing from Turkey 
to Greece (see Fig. 9).

In one case detected on 17 June 2011, a small 
(5 m) fibreglass boat was intercepted in the 
waters of the Balearic Islands with 11 Alge-
rians onboard. It had departed from the vil-
lage of Dellys (Algeria) near Algiers. This was 
the second boat carrying migrants detected 
in 2011 in the waters of the isle of Mallorca 
(the first one was intercepted in January). 
However, reports from multiple sources 
suggest that migrants are increasingly us-
ing unseaworthy vessels to attempt the 
crossing from Morocco to both the Span-
ish mainland and the cities of Melilla and 
Ceuta (see Fig. 10).
Clandestine migrants hiding in vehicles
Compared to detections of illegal border-
crossing, detections of clandestine en-
try at external EU borders are very low 
(242 detections in 2011), but cases detected 
at internal EU borders suggest that the 
actual number of clandestine entries at 
the external border may be much higher. 
For example, within the EU there were 
1 407 detections in 2011.
In 2011 several detections of clandestine 
migrants hidden in lorries transporting 
goods from Turkey or Greece to (other) EU 
countries were made in Romania on exit 
at the border with Hungary. In one case 
36 clandestine migrants were detected 
(31 Afghans, four Pakistanis, one Iranian) 
hidden in a lorry transporting engine oil 
from Greece to Germany, 15 of them in 
possession of Greek asylum documents. 
They had been placed in the lorry in Bul-
garia by the facilitators who had previously 
helped them to cross the border between 
Greece and Bulgaria. In another case eight 
migrants were discovered (six Syrians, one 
Iraqi, one Turk) hidden in a lorry transport-
ing cables from Turkey to Slovakia. After 
detection, the six Syrian nationals claimed 
to be Palestinians.
In 2011 there was an increase in detections 
of stowaways in the Spanish Port of Ma-
laga, where there is a significant flow of 
goods and passengers from Ceuta and Me-
lilla. Apart from merchant vessels, regular 
passenger ferry lines are also used to trans-
port different goods from those northern 
African territories to mainland Spain. As 
the control of passengers is very strong 
both in the port of departure and on ar-
rival, migrants hide in containers, trailers, 
lorry axes and below false bottoms of ve-
hicles. According to the Western Balkan 
Risk Analysis Network, detections of clan-
destine entries in the region are on the in-
crease. Most detections were of Afghans 
and Pakistanis detected in Serbia, Croatia 
and Slovenia hidden in or under vehicles 
heading from Greece, usually without the 
driver knowing.
Overstaying the legal length of stay
Overstaying the length of the visa period is 
probably a common modus operandi for mi-
grants illegally staying in the EU. It is very 
difficult to establish at the border, because 
migrants have genuine travel documents. 
According to the Schengen Borders Code, 
border guards can nevertheless refuse en-
try on nine grounds, two of them related 
to overstaying. The first reason is the lack 
of appropriate documentation justifying

the purpose of stay that is used to prevent 
overstaying, the second is for having already 
stayed for more than three months within 
a six-month period. Together, these two 
reasons for refusals totalled approximately 
31 700 cases in 2011 and accounted for 27% 
of all refusals reported by Member States.
Forged travel documents
All Member States that responded to a sur-
vey in the framework of a Frontex risk anal-
ysis project in 2011 considered document 
fraud to be a high-priority issue. Document 
fraud is widely accepted to be important 
for several reasons. First, this type of fraud 
allows migrants in an irregular or unlawful 
situation to enter the territory of a Mem-
ber State, and to move freely within the 
EU. Secondly, assuming a false identity and 
operating within black markets seriously 
undermines international criminal inves-
tigations and national social systems and 
the ability of any state to effectively man-
age and protect its legitimate communi-
ties. Finally, document fraud progressively 
demands closer and stronger links to or-
ganised crime because modern documents 
require more skilled and expensive tech-
niques to produce quality forgeries, and 
because the emerging trend of imperson-
ation has created an illegal market place 
for large volumes of stolen or complicity 
supplied documents.
According to the FRAN data, between 2010 
and 2011 there was just a 1.4% increase in 
the number of individuals detected using 
false (forged or counterfeit) documents to 
enter the EU; this is a steady trend despite 
reports of a widespread shift away from 
false documents towards genuine doc-
ument abuse, which includes imperson-
ation, fraudulently obtained documents 
and abuse of legal channels. Hence, in the 
presence of a shift towards genuine docu-
ment abuse, detections of false-document 
users increasingly underestimate the over-
all trend of document fraud. Nearly half 
of all detections of false-document users 
were of nationals from just five countries 
– Ukraine, Albania, Morocco, Iran and Ni-
geria; of the remaining nationalities, around 
150 were detected at very low frequencies.
Consistent with previous years around 
three-quarters of all detections on entry 
were at the external air border. Moreo-
ver, detections at the air border increased 
relative to decreases at the land and sea 
borders, which is the reversal of previous 
trends. For example, the ARA 2011 showed 
that detections of false document users 
had increased proportionately more at 
the land and sea borders and the Tailored 
Risk Assessment on False Documents 2011 
showed a strong trend away from the use 
of passports towards less sophisticated 
documents such as ID cards and residence 
permits (see Fig. 11). Hence, the FRAN data 
for 2011 may suggest a reversal of this trend, 
as passports are by far the most common 
document used at the air border.
As is typically the case with document 
fraud, in 2011 Member States experienced 
pressure from an extensive range of forgery

techniques applied to many types of docu-
ments and used by a very wide assortment 
of nationalities. Such a broad landscape of 
document fraud inevitably renders profiling 
and effective control extremely challeng-
ing, and confirms the utility of developing 
systematic analyses, alerts and operational 
support at the EU level.
Furthermore, the abuse of authentic doc-
uments clearly illustrates the dynamically 
changing landscape of document fraud, and 
confirms the importance of developing and 
updating traditional approaches to docu-
ment fraud that have, to date, tended to 
limit their focus to false documents (forged 
and counterfeit). Document fraud is also 
manifestly an international phenomenon; 
therefore systematic approaches to docu-
ment fraud should be conducted at a higher 
than national level, with a particular em-
phasis on improving profiling and identify-
ing, and quickly disseminating information 
on emerging modi operandi.
These needs are currently being addressed 
by the European Union Document-Fraud 
(EDF) Project at Frontex, which aims to sig-
nificantly develop and maintain the situa-
tional picture of document fraud to cross 
borders of the EU and Schengen Area. This 
ambitious project has formed a risk anal-
ysis community specialising in document 
fraud, and aims to standardise terms, def-
initions and reporting protocols at the EU 
level in order to implement data collec-
tion and effective analysis of all cases of 
document fraud detected at the exter-
nal borders, including the abuse of genu-
ine documents.
Authentic documents obtained with 
false supporting documentation
Fraudulent supporting documents in sup-
port of visa applications or resident per-
mits were being widely reported. There is a 
degree of organised criminality associated 
with document provision but intelligence 
on criminal networks behind this type of 
fraud are difficult to obtain because it of-
ten involved forgeries made in third coun-
tries. Those associated with this abuse are 
able to adapt rapidly.
Sham marriages are used to obtain per-
mission to live within the EU and were 
mentioned with increasing frequency in 
the media. This suggests that this modus 
operandi may be on the rise, particularly 
involving females from the new 2004 EU 
Member States and males from Africa and 
Asia.
3.3. Other illegal activities
Frontex mandate is related to irregular mi-
gration; however, border guards in cooper-
ation with customs officers and the police 
are also engaged in combating other crim-
inal activities at the border such as smug-
gling of goods and THB. This section is an 
overview of cross-border crimes affecting 
the work of border guards at the external 
borders of the EU identified during Frontex 
operations and in Member States reports 
in 2011. The analysis is structured around 
the following issues: (1) drugs, (2) smug-
gling of excise goods (cigarettes and oil 
products), (3) stolen vehicles (on exit), and 
(4) THB. The text aims to provide an over-

view of the points of entry, routes of traf-
ficking and the modus operandi.
3.3.1. Drugs
Routes of drug trafficking vary depending 
on the kind of drugs, its origin and the crim-
inal organisation involved. During Frontex 
Joint Operations, similarly to the year be-
fore, drug seizures were reported mainly on 
the Western Balkan route, Eastern Med-
iterranean route and Western Mediter-
ranean route. In addition, Member States 
continue to report significant smuggling 
of drugs via individual couriers on flights 
originating from South America and the 
Caribbean.
The main points of entry for heroin into the 
EU remain on the Eastern Mediterranean 
route, at the external borders with Turkey. 
The illicit drug is transported along a route 
that is similar to the route used for smug-
gling migrants, i.e. leading from Afghanistan 
through Pakistan, Iran and Turkey. During 
the permanent Frontex JO Focal Points 
Land 2011, heroin was detected at the Bul-
garian border with Turkey (BCP Kaptian An-
dreevo) concealed in personal bags, baby 
nappies, slicked to the body, but also hidden 
in private cars. Drug trafficking in lorries 
seems to be on the decline, as there were 
no detections at BCP Kapitan Andreevo in 
2011. This trend is confirmed by the crimi-
nal analysis of the Turkish police showing 
that most cases of heroin detection in 2010 
involved smuggling in private cars rather 
than on buses or in lorries. This is an in-
dication that criminal organisations have 
opted for transport of illicit drugs in small 
quantities and consequently, rely rather on 
smaller than larger vehicles.
The Western Balkan route is also often 
used as at transit region for drugs held by 
Western Balkan criminal groups. According 
to Frontex JO Focal Points Land 2011 (JO FP 
Land 2011), the main illicit drugs detected 
were heroin and cannabis, mostly smuggled 
by Albanians en route to Western Europe. 
A classic modus operandi of Albanian drug 
smugglers is the concealment of drugs in 
hidden compartments, like double-walled 
lorries and double-bottomed containers. 
Most of the drugs smuggled through the 
Western Balkans are destined for western 
European Member States, i.e. the Nether-
lands, Belgium, France and the UK. 
By contrast, there was no report of heroin 
smuggling during Frontex Joint Operations 
on the ‘silk road’ crossing the EU eastern 
land borders.
The Western Mediterranean route is 
mostly used for trafficking of hashish from 
Morocco and cocaine from South America 
after transit through western and north-
ern Africa. During the 45 operational days 
of Frontex JO Minerva in 2011 in the West-
ern Mediterranean area, about six tonnes 
of hashish was seized. This corresponded 
to a significant increase in daily detections 
of illicit drugs compared to 2010 (+33% in 
the number of detections and +117% in the 
quantity seized). Based on the interviews 
of the smugglers, the drug was destined 
to a large number of different Member 
States, an indication of the level of or-
ganisation and the presence in several 
Member States of criminal groups active 
in drug smuggling at the EU external bor-
der. By order of frequency, the final desti-
nations mentioned during the interviews 
of the smugglers were: Spain, France, Bel-
gium, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and 
Germany. During Frontex JO Indalo on the 
Spanish Costa de Levante, 12  tonnes of 
hashish was also seized. Drug smugglers 
use classic modi operandi ranging from con-
cealment in vehicle, swallowing drugs for 
smuggling through BCP to using  drug-filled 
 inflatable boats and fishing boats to cross 
the blue borders.
Frontex · annual risk analysis 2012

The use of small aircraft (see Fig. 12) for co-
caine and hashish trafficking to the Iberian 
Peninsula was reported on the increase in 
2011. According to JO Indalo reports and 
open sources, about ten light aircraft were 
detected smuggling drugs from Morocco 
to the Spanish coast in 2011. On June 16, 
as part of ‘Operation Saffron,’ the Span-
ish authorities detected two light aircraft 
flying illicitly from Morocco. The planes 
were searched, four men were arrested 
and 700 kg of hashish seized. This modus 
operandi imitates the method used by crim-
inal groups in South and Central America 
and might be an indication of these groups 
exporting their knowledge and gaining 
ground in the EU.
Cocaine smugglers’ modus operandi remains 
the same and is mostly based on traffick-
ing through maritime and air borders. Ac-
cording to UNODC individual drug couriers 
travelling from South America or West Af-
rica are continuously smuggling cocaine 
hidden in luggage, stuck to body, hidden 
in body cavities and swallowed (the so-
called ‘drug mules’). In 2011 reintroduction 
of trafficking liquid cocaine by drug cou-
riers was also reported. Cocaine in solu-
tion was predominantly seized at airports 
and seaports. 
At the sea borders it is smuggled on tour-
ist boats, cargo freighters, container ships 
but its was also reported that aircraft are 
used to drop cocaine bundles to interna-
tional waters was reported. According to 
UNODC in 2011 there was some evidence 
that drug cartels from West Africa were 
making use of submarines to facilitate their 
trade. These ’narco-submarines‘ can carry 
relatively large quantities of drugs and are 
very hard to detect.
Some synthetic drugs were seized at the 
external borders, yet in insignificant quan-
tities, which might result from the fact 
that domestic production in Europe sat-
isfied the drug market demand. In fact, 
recent seizures of synthetic drugs were 
mostly made on passengers on exit. This 
may be linked to the new trend of ‘narco-
tourism’, particularly practiced by Bra-
zilians. Young, educated, middle-class 
Brazilians are contacted by drug traffick-
ers offering them trips to the EU with all 
the expenses paid. In return, young peo-
ple carry drugs (mostly ecstasy and LSD) 
on the way back to Brazil, where they are 
further compensated for the job. Belgium 
and the Netherlands are the most com-
mon destination countries in the EU for 
’narco-tourism‘. When leaving Europe, the 
drug carriers may transit through different 
EU airports, Lisbon being a major transit 
point. In Brazil, the target airports are sec-
ondary hubs, such as the airports in Belo 
Horizonte, Salvador and Recife, where di-
rect flights to Portugal, Spain, France and 
Germany are available.

3.3.2. Smuggling of excise goods
Smuggling of tobacco
The smuggling of excise goods is a diverse 
phenomenon related to the customs regu-
lations in place in both the bordering coun-
tries and the price gaps existing between 
particular goods. The most common ex-
cise goods smuggled across the external 
border of the EU are cigarettes and pe-
troleum products.
Cigarette smuggling significantly affects 
the work of border authorities on the east-
ern land border and the land borders with 
Western Balkan countries (see Fig. 13). It is 
also increasingly reported at the sea and 
air borders. Cigarette smuggling is per-
ceived by organised crime groups (OCG) 
as a ‘low risk – high profit’ enterprise, es-
pecially if compared to drug trafficking 
which, though highly lucrative, carries with 
it hefty penalties. Main destination coun-
tries for smuggled cigarettes are Western 
European countries such as the UK, Ire-
land, France, Belgium, Germany, Scandina-
vian countries and those located along the 
eastern border of the EU. These eastern 
countries are also used as transit countries, 
as cigarettes are frequently transported 
within Eastern European immigrant net-
works from their home countries to above 
mentioned Western European destination 
countries. In the case of cigarettes smug-
gled across sea borders, the main desti-
nation countries are Cyprus, Greece, Italy 
and the UK.
According to Frontex JO Focal Points Land 
2011 detections of cigarette smuggling at 
eastern borders in 2011 were 50% lower 
than in 2010. However, this does not in-
clude cigarette seizures made by law-en-
forcement authorities near the external 
border. For instance in September, the 
Polish authorities reported the detection 
of 3 700 cartons of cigarettes in transit 
from Lithuania.
The modi operandi of cigarette smugglers 
are diverse. They range from ‘ant’ smug-
gling carried out by individuals to large 
scale enterprises which involve the use of 
cars, buses, lorries, trains, and even aero-
planes. Incidents of cigarette smuggling 
involving diplomatic personnel were re-
ported. Smugglers were also reported us-
ing off-road vehicles and tractors as well 
as small boats along the River Nemunas 
or the River Bug, the border rivers in Be-
lorussia and Ukraine, respectively.
There were also several reports in 2011 of 
migrants being smuggled together with 
cigarettes on the Eastern Mediterranean 
land route. In March 2011, two Pakistani 
migrants claimed to have been trans-
ported 1 300 km from the Iranian-Turk-
ish border to Istanbul in a lorry carrying 
approximately 30 other migrants and a 
considerable amount of cigarettes hid-
den in a concealed compartment. Some 
months later, in October 2011, another 
Pakistani migrant claimed to have been 
transported hidden in a lorry full of cig-

arettes. According to the Turkish media, 
a Turkish registered lorry was stopped 
by the police en  route from Dogubeyazit 
(near the Iranian border) to Istanbul. In 
the lorry, the police found not only 53 mi-
grants (Pakistanis and Afghans) but also 
approximately 2.5 million illegal cigarettes 
in a hidden compartment. These cases 
indicate the length of the journey that 
clandestine migrants are prepared to un-
dertake, presumably in very cramped con-
ditions. Moreover, they also show that 
either two different criminal networks are 
cooperating to use the same transporta-
tion logistics in Turkey, or a single facili-
tation network is dealing with both the 
smuggling of cigarettes and the facilita-
tion of migrants.
During JO Poseidon 2011 seizures of ciga-
rettes at sea borders were also reported. 
Smugglers used cargo vessels heading from 
Ukraine and Moldova to Cyprus, Greece and 
Italy. In three incidents, 276 000 cartons of 
cigarettes were detected.
Trafficking of petroleum products
Trafficking of oil products is mainly re-
ported at the eastern European borders 
with the Russian Federation, Belarus, and 
Ukraine, as well as with Balkan states (e.g. 
Serbia). This kind of smuggling is motivated 
by the price difference between EU Mem-
ber States and their immediate third-coun-
try neighbours. In most cases smugglers 
used illegally reconstructed petrol tanks 
with significantly enlarged capacity, as well 
as buses and off-road vehicles to transport 
large barrels and fuel containers.
Though gasoline smuggling is commonly 
believed to have only a limited and local 
impact on the EU economy, fuel smug-
glers present a challenge to the manage-
ment of the movement at borders. Firstly, 
this is because the queues created by them 
increase the waiting time at border-cross-
ing points. Secondly, modifications to ve-
hicles to increase their fuel capacity, e.g. 
expanded fuel tanks, add to the security 
risks. Though uncommon, incidents of ex-
ploding vehicles carrying smuggled fuel are 
not unheard of and the threat is increased 
when the price gap creates a higher de-
mand, this in turn intensifying the smug-
gling pressure.
3.3.3. Stolen vehicles
Stolen vehicles are obviously mainly iden-
tified in connection to the control at land 
borders and, to a lesser extent, sea bor-
ders. In recent years, stolen vehicles de-
tected on the eastern land border and the 
land border with the Western Balkans had 
been mostly stolen in Belgium, Germany, 
France and Italy. Intelligence received from 
Member States points to an increase in 
trafficking of stolen vehicles leaving the 
EU at the external border between Bul-
garia and Turkey.
The most common modus operandi is the 
transit of vehicles with falsified documents, 
smuggling cars dismantled into spare parts 
(see Fig. 14), transportation of vehicles on 
a platform trailer or train, trafficking of 
Figure 14: Smuggling of dismantled stolen

leased cars, and altering vehicle identifi-
cation numbers (VIN number). The latter 
modus operandi, however, has been reported 
on the decrease.
Given the sophistication of the modi oper-
andi, the detection of stolen vehicles is very 
time consuming. It relies mostly on the pro-
filing of drivers, hence the collaboration of 
law-enforcement authorities active within 
the territories and border-control author-
ities is of crucial importance here.
In 2011, stolen heavy vehicles, machines, 
buses and trailers have been reported on 
the increase, particularly those from the 
UK, France, Germany or Spain. The de-
tected vehicles were mostly being trans-
ported to Belarus and Ukraine.
Frontex JO Minerva 2011 at the Spanish 
sea borders provided additional evidence 
for stolen vehicles being smuggled to Mo-
rocco. As many as 34 stolen vehicles were 
detected during the Joint Operation. In 
comparison to 2010, the daily detection 
average increased sevenfold in 2011. Most 
cases involved luxury cars (such as BMW, 
Porsche Cayenne and Audi). Their theft 
was mainly reported in France, Italy and 
Spain, and, less commonly, in Belgium and 
the Netherlands. The drivers were mainly 
Moroccan and, to a lesser extent, European 
nationals (from Italy, France, the Nether-
lands, Romania, Spain and Belgium).
3.3.4. Trafficking in human beings
Trafficking in human beings (THB) is prob-
ably one of the most profitable cross-bor-
der crimes and it is often associated with 
other criminal activities. However, it is not 
easily detected at the borders, because at 
that moment of the trafficking process, 
the victims themselves are either una-
ware of their fate or afraid to collaborate 
with law-enforcement authorities. Never-
theless, this criminal activity is closely re-
lated to the movement of people, including 
movement across borders, and thus bor-
der-control authorities can be instrumen-
tal in preventing it. While many victims 
come from Member States themselves, 
this analysis focuses on victims from third 
countries, as they are more likely to have 
crossed the external border at some point 
of the trafficking process.
According to information received from 
Member States, the top nationalities de-
tected as victims of human trafficking in 
the EU still include Brazilians, Chinese, Ni-
gerians, Ukrainians and Vietnamese. In ad-
dition, victims from other third countries 
like Albania, Ghana, Morocco, Moldova, 
Egypt, Indian, the Philippines and the Do-
minican Republic have also been reported, 
illustrating the broad geographical distribu-
tion of the places of origin of victims. Most 
THB cases are related to illegal work and 
sexual exploitation in Europe.
In some cases, the distinction between the 
smuggling of migrants and THB is not easily 
established because some of the migrants 
are initially using the services of smugglers, 
but it is only later, once in the EU, that they 
may fall victim to THB. According to intel-
ligence from JO Hermes, this is particularly 
the case for women embarking for illegal 
border-crossing from North Africa to the 
EU. Once in Europe, some of them are in-
timated by their smugglers and forced into 
prostitution.
A worrying trend reported during JO In-
dalo is the increasing number of detections 
of illegal border-crossing by minors and 
pregnant women (see Fig. 15), as criminal 
groups are taking advantage of an immi-
gration law preventing their return. Al-
though it is not clear whether these cases 
are related to THB, women and children are 
among the most vulnerable. Most of these

women claimed to be from Nigeria, Côte 
d’Ivoire and Cameroon and were between 
the fifth and ninth month of pregnancy. 
Minors were identified as being from Ni-
geria, Algeria and Congo.
Another modus operandi is for the criminal 
groups to convince their victim to apply 
for international protection. Such modus 
operandi was illustrated by the verdict of 
a Dutch court case in July 2011, when one 
suspect was convicted for trafficking of 
Nigerian female minors. The asylum pro-
cedure in the Netherlands was misused 
by the criminal organisation to get an ac-
commodation for the victims. The victims 
were forced to sexual exploitation in sev-
eral Member States.

4.  Economic and legal 
developments
Austerity measures in Member States
Austerity measures, designed to reduce 
budget deficits, improve investor confi-
dence or obtain new credit lines have been 
introduced throughout Member States in 
various forms already from 2009 onwards. 
The most obvious examples of such meas-
ures include Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain 
and the Baltic countries.
Importantly, austerity measures have in-
tensified somewhat during 2011. For exam-
ple, in Bulgaria the plan included reducing 
public spending by $584 million by cutting 
funds to almost all government ministries. 
In addition, a reduction of public sector 
jobs by 10% and a freezing wages for up to 
three years was part of the same package.
In the case of the UK, the government un-
veiled the country’s steepest public spend-
ing cuts in more than 60 years. According 
to the plan, roughly EUR 83 billion in spend-
ing cuts should be achieved by 2015, bring-
ing the 11% of GDP budget deficit down to 
1% over the next three years.
The Hungarian government’s plans include 
a 15% cut in public sector expenditure (sav-
ing EUR 171 million), a lower wage ceiling for 
public sector employees and the elimina-
tion of the 13th month payment. In Lithua-
nia, the austerity measures encompass a 
two year freeze in public sector salaries, a 
30% decrease in public spending and a 11% 
cut of public-sector pensions.
In conclusion, given the unfavourable eco-
nomic climate in the EU, austerity measures 
*  European Economic 
Forecast – Autumn 2011
4.1. Economic factors
Euro-area economic crisis continues
Europe’s economic crisis has entered its 
third year in 2012. The deterioration of the 
economic situation in the EU has been 
widely associated with a substantially 
worsened development in financial mar-
kets, including sovereign debt concerns 
and banking sector issues, and a weaker-
than-expected global recovery.
The European Commission (EC) expects* 
that almost all Member States will expe-
rience a slowdown of economic growth or 
even periods of contraction during 2012, 
while in 2013 a modest recovery is likely. 
Substantial differences will persist across 
Member States also in terms of job crea-
tion and unemployment rates. For exam-
ple, among the largest economies Spain 
recorded the highest increase in unemploy-
ment rates in 2011 (up to 21.2% from 20.4%) 
whereas Germany reported almost 1% drop 
in its unemployment rate (to roughly 6.0%). 
Poland, Belgium and Austria have also come 
out of the downturn with lower unemploy-
ment rates (see Fig. 16).
The EC’s autumn 2011 forecast suggests 
that the unemployment rate will increase 
in nearly half of Member States during 2012. 
Unemployment rates are expected to vary 
between about 4% in Austria and more 
than 20% in Spain. These differences in la-
bour demand will continue to impact des-
tination choices of labour migrants coming 
to the EU during 2012 and 2013.

4.2. Legal factors
Visa Information System rolled-out in 
North Africa
Following several years of delays, the Visa 
Information System (VIS) started operat-
ing in North Africa (Algeria, Egypt, Libya, 
Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia) during 
October 2011.
The new system is designed to process bio-
metric data (photo and all ten fingerprints) 
and decisions related to all applications for 
short-stay or transit Schengen visas (see 
Fig.  17). According to the EC, when fully 
operational, Visa Information System will 
deliver faster border checks, more accu-
rate visa procedures, better protection of 
travellers against identity-theft and more 
security.
In terms of the immediate impact on bor-
der checks in Member States, border-con-
trol authorities (only those selected) are

now obliged to systematically check the 
visa sticker number in the VIS. Match-
ing the fingerprints of the visa holder 
with the visa sticker number will only be-
come obligatory after a transitional pe-
riod of three years. This obligation will 
not apply for a limited set of extraordi-
nary circumstances (e.g. intense regular 
passenger flow and the need to facilitate 
bona fide travellers).
The North Africa region should be followed 
by the Near East (Israel, Jordan, Lebanon 
and Syria), and the Gulf regions (Afghan-
istan, Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, 
Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emir-
ates, and Yemen). All Schengen States’ 
consular posts worldwide should be con-
nected to the Visa Information System 
within two years.
Visa liberalisation process continues
The case of the Western Balkans clearly 
showed that visa liberalisation can produce 
significant negative consequences with 
fairly small minority groups having a dis-
proportionate impact. Unfounded asylum 
applications from particular marginalised 
groups in Serbia and to a lesser extent also 
in other Western Balkan countries have 
significantly increased after the new legal 
travel channel became available.
Importantly, the specific case of the Western 
Balkans did not halt visa liberalisation proc-

streamline checks 
Visa Information System – the technical background
Visa Information System consists of three main building blocks: a central database, a national in-
terface in each Schengen state, and a communication infrastructure between the central database 
and the national interfaces. This system architecture enables competent authorities of the Schen-
gen States to process data on visa applications and on all visas that are issued, annulled, refused, 
revoked or extended.
The Visa Information System central database has alphanumerical searching capabilities for check-
ing the veracity of a given visa sticker number aided by a system (AFIS) that compares new finger-
prints against those in the database and returns hit/no hit responses, along with matches.
Currently, the central database is located in France (Strasbourg) and a back-up, capable of ensuring 
all functionalities is located in Austria (Sankt Johann im Pongau). By the end of 2012, the Agency 
for the management of large-scale IT systems in the area of justice, freedom and security will 
become the Managing Authority of VIS.

esses with other EU partner countries. In 
fact, structured visa dialogues with Ukraine 
and Moldova that started at the end of 2009 
and middle of 2010 respectively, have been 
proceeding as originally planned. The Coun-
cil invited the European Commission (EC) to 
draft Action Plans setting out all the condi-
tions to be met by Ukraine and Moldova be-
fore the possible establishment of a visa-free 
travel regime and to report regularly on the 
plans’ implementation. The EC will present 
its assessment of wider security and migra-
tory impacts of possible visa liberalisation for 
the two countries later in 2012 (April). The 
EC’s positive assessment is a precondition 
for the start of the second phase of both 
visa liberalisation Action Plans.
Visa safeguard clause as a new policy 
tool to counter possible abuse of visa 
liberalisation
The European Commission’s proposal for 
an amendment of Regulation 539/2001 
continues to be discussed in co-decision 
procedure. The proposal has evolved some-
what since it was introduced in May 2011. 
However, the temporary suspension of 
the visa waiver for a third country whose 
nationals are exempted from the visa ob-
ligation is still the main point of the men-
tioned proposal. According to the EC, the 
updated regulation will come into force 
during 2012.
A Member State will thus have the oppor-
tunity to notify the EC if it is confronted 
with one or more of the following circum-
stances leading to an emergency situation 
due to substantial and sudden increase of:
(a)  Illegal stay over a six month period 
compared to the same period prior to 
visa liberalisation
(b)  Asylum applications which are man-
ifestly unfounded or which do not 
fulfil the conditions for international 
protection
(c)  Rejected readmission applications sub-
mitted by a Member State to a visa-free 
third country in question.
Such a mechanism should only be a meas-
ure of last resort and can be applied to any 
third country exempted from the visa ob-
ligation. Importantly, a request by Mem-
ber State will not automatically lead to 
the re-imposition of the visa obligation 
for the  citizens of the third country con-
cerned. The EC will consider a number of 
Unfounded asylum applications from the Western Balkans continued at lower levels in 2011
In 2011 the overall number of asylum applications made by nationals from the five visa-exempt West-
ern Balkan countries (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Mac-
edonia and Montenegro) in all the Member States decreased by roughly one quarter compared to 
2010. Nevertheless, the numbers still remained relatively high at slightly more than 9% of all asy-
lum applications submitted in the EU (down from a 14% share recorded in 2010).
Despite more than a 30% decrease compared to 2010, Serbian nationals continued to be the sin-
gle largest visa-exempt nationality claiming asylum in the EU during 2011. Serbs remained the 
second-ranked nationality (after Afghans) of asylum applicants in the EU.

elements in its assessment, including re-
porting from Frontex. In any case, the EC 
will have to submit its proposal within 
three months after receiving a request to 
re-impose visa obligation, however, the 
temporary suspension of the visa waiver 
will only be possible for periods of up to 
six months.
Frontex · annual risk analysis 2012 
38 of 60
The following risks at the external borders 
of the EU were identified according to the 
results of an annual risk analysis process in-
volving Member State analysts participat-
ing in the Frontex Risk Analysis Network. 
They represent the main risks identified by 
the Frontex Risk Analysis Unit after an An-
nual Analytical Review with Member State 
analysts. 
The risks are described with the objective 
to inform decision makers in the Frontex 
Management Board when preparing the 
Programme of Work for 2013 and other high 
level planning and strategic decision proc-
esses. Thus, they are primarily aimed for 
strategic and planning purposes, and re-
quire specific tailored analysis for tactical 
and operational decisions.
 Risks are presented with reference to their 
components of threat, vulnerability and im-
pact. Threats are described as the forces 
or pressure acting from the outside on the 
external borders. Vulnerabilities are un-
derstood as the factors at a specific border 
section or type or within the EU that might 
increase or decrease the magnitude or like-
lihood of the threat. Impacts are defined as 
the effects on the internal security and the 
security of the external border. Widely appli-
cable impacts, such as infringements of the 
Schengen Borders Code or breaches of do-
mestic immigration laws, are not repeated.
1. Risk of large and sustained numbers 
of illegal border-crossing at the 
external land and sea border with 
Turkey
The border between Greece and Turkey is 
very likely to remain in 2013 among the main 
areas of detections of illegal border cross-
5. Conclusions
ing along the external border, at levels sim-
ilar to those reported between 2008 and 
2011, i.e. between 40 000 and 57 000 de-
tections per annum.
This area of the external border neighbours 
Turkey and offers a natural transit bridge 
with Asia, which includes many source 
countries for migrants hoping to illegally 
cross the border to the EU. This situation is 
largely exploited by facilitators, in particu-
lar at the land border between Turkey and 
Greece. The challenge is ever increasing, as 
criminal groups continue to develop their 
networks and practices across the Greek-
Turkish borders.
The majority of migrants are expected to 
come from Asian countries particularly Af-
ghanistan, Iran and Pakistan, pushed by poor 
living conditions at home and pulled by the 
presence of a large number of fellow citi-
zens already in the EU, relatively low return 
risk at this particular border section com-
pared other border sections like air borders, 
rumours spreading among migrants about 
benefits available in EU Member States and 
long-term established perceptions about 
apparent easiness to cross illegally to the EU 
and which feedbacks from recent successes.
Depending on the political situation, mi-
grants from the Middle East may increas-
ingly join the flow. In addition, migrants 
from northern and western Africa, willing 
to illegally cross the EU external borders, are 
expected to increasingly take advantage of 
the Turkish visa policies, granting visas to a 
different set of nationalities than the EU, and 
the expansion of Turkish Airlines, to transit 
through the Turkish air borders to subse-
quently attempt to enter the EU illegally, ei-
ther by air or through the neighbouring land 
39 of 60
or sea borders. As a result, border-control 
authorities will increasingly be confronted 
with a wider variety of nationalities, and 
probably also a greater diversity of facili-
tation networks, further complicating the 
tasks of law-enforcement authorities.
This risk is interlinked with the risk of crim-
inal groups facilitating secondary move-
ments and the risk of border-control 
authorities faced with large flows of peo-
ple in search of international protection. 
2. Risk of document fraud to 
circumvent border-control measures
The use of biometric travel documents 
renders document fraud increasingly diffi-
cult. Nevertheless, facilitators are develop-
ing new techniques to circumvent biometric 
checks, such as the use of supporting doc-
uments to fraudulently obtain authentic 
travel documents, or impostor techniques. 
Consistent with the distribution of regular 
passengers among border types (land, air 
and sea), this risk is mostly associated with 
passenger entries at the external air borders, 
and to a lesser extent at the land borders. 
Fraud is expected mostly among EU travel 
documents (e.g. passports, visas and ID 
cards) and there are indications of a shift 
away from the use of passports towards 
less sophisticated documents such as ID 
cards and residence permits. 
Member States experience pressure from 
an extensive range of forgery techniques 
applied to many types of documents and 
used by a very wide assortment of nation-
alities. Such a broad landscape of document 
fraud inevitably renders profiling and ef-
fective control extremely challenging, and 
confirms the utility of developing system-
atic analyses, alerts and operational sup-
port at the EU level.
Document fraud allows migrants to illegally 
enter the territory of a Member State, and 
then to move freely within the EU. In addi-
tion, assuming a false identity and operating 
within black markets seriously undermines 
international criminal investigations as well 
as national social systems and the ability of 
any state to effectively manage and protect 
its legitimate communities. Document fraud 
progressively demands closer and stronger 
links to organised crime because modern 
documents require more skilled and ex-
pensive techniques to produce quality for-
geries, and because the emerging trend of 
impersonation has created an illegal market 
place for large volumes of stolen or com-
plicity supplied documents.
3. Risk of renewed large numbers of 
illegal border-crossing at the southern 
maritime border
The likelihood of large numbers of illegal 
border-crossing in the southern maritime 
border remains very high, either in the form 
of sporadic episodes similar to those re-
ported in 2011 or in sustained flows on spe-
cific routes originating from Africa.
Irregular-migration flows at the southern 
maritime borders are expected to be con-
centrated within one of the three known 
routes, i.e. the Central Mediterranean route, 
the Western Mediterranean route or the 
Western African route. Larger flows are 
more likely to develop on the Central Med-
iterranean route than on the other two 
routes, because of its proximity to Tunisia, 
Libya and Egypt, where political instability 
and high unemployment rate among young 
people is pushing people away from their 
countries and where there is evidence for 
well-organised facilitation networks.
On the Western Mediterranean route, the 
situation remains of concern because of 
the increasing trend of illegal border-cross-
Frontex · annual risk analysis 2012 
40 of 60
ing reported throughout 2011. According to 
reported detections, the situation on the 
Western African route has been mostly un-
der control since 2008 but remains critically 
dependant of the implementation of effec-
tive return agreements between Spain and 
western African countries. Should these 
agreements be jeopardised, irregular mi-
gration pushed by high unemployment and 
poverty is likely to resume quickly despite 
increased surveillance. 
The composition of the flow is dependent 
on the route and the countries of depar-
ture, but includes a large majority of west-
ern and North Africans. Mostly economically 
driven, irregular migration on these routes 
is also increasingly dependent on the hu-
manitarian crisis in western and northern 
African countries. Facilitators are increas-
ingly recruiting their candidates for illegal 
border-crossing from the group that are 
most vulnerable to THB, i.e. women and 
children, causing increasing challenges for 
border control authorities.
4. Risk of border-control authorities 
faced with large numbers of people in 
search of international protection
Given the currently volatile and unstable 
security situation in the vicinity of the EU, 
there is an increasing risk of political and 
humanitarian crises in third countries re-
sulting in large numbers of people in search 
of international protection being displaced 
to the land and sea borders of the EU. The 
most likely pressures are linked to the sit-
uation in North Africa and the Middle East. 
In addition, the situation in western African 
countries like Nigeria may also trigger flows 
of people in search of international protec-
tion at the external borders.
In addition, facilitators of illegal border-
crossing often recommend migrants to ap-
ply for international protection if detected at 
the external borders, only to abscond from 
the asylum centres a few days later. This 
threat is predominantly linked with irreg-
ular transit migration through the Western 
Balkan route and possibly, more sporadically, 
also along the eastern land border. Facili-
tators are exploiting the period, often sev-
eral months, required for assessing asylum 
applications, and the lack of common pol-
icy on international protection at the EU 
level is part of the modus operandi proposed 
in their packages to the migrants. Their il-
legal activities are also thriving because of 
the still insufficient coordination between 
border-control and other law-enforcement 
authorities with asylum authorities.
When applications for international protec-
tion are made in large numbers as part of 
a modus operandi to illegally enter the EU, it 
overloads border-control authorities, thus 
diluting resources for those genuinely re-
quiring protection while at the same time 
diverting resources that would otherwise 
be used to carry out border controls.
5. Risk of increased facilitation of 
secondary movements of illegal 
stayers in the EU
The persistently large number of annual il-
legal border-crossings along the external 
borders, oscillating between 100 000 and 
© Frontex 2007
41 of 60
150 000 detections since EU totals have 
been available in 2008, has created a mar-
ket for criminal organisations facilitating the 
movement of illegal stayers within the EU. 
There is an increasing risk that these sec-
ondary movements are adding to the pull 
factors for illegal border-crossing at the EU 
external borders.
Member States are increasingly reporting 
migrants who, after crossing the external 
border illegally, transit through Greece via 
the intra-Schengen air border using fraud-
ulent documents. In support of this, the Eu-
ropol Organised Crime Threat Assessment 
(OCTA 2011) highlighted organised crime 
groups in Pakistan as key producers and 
suppliers of counterfeit identity documents 
and linked the supply with the current high 
levels of irregular migration to Greece, and 
the identification of laboratories producing 
counterfeit documents in Greece.
The facilitation of secondary movement of 
illegal stayers takes advantage of cheaper 
connections between small airports of EU 
Member States, as well as an increase in on-
line check-in systems that reduce the possi-
bility of detection of fraudulent documents. 
At the land borders, the Western Balkan 
route remained largely a function of tran-
siting flow of migrants that enter the EU 
at Greek-Turkish borders and later con-
tinue towards other Member States through 
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedo-
nia, Serbia and Croatia. Detections of ille-
gal border-crossing at the land borders with 
Western Balkan countries in Slovenia, Hun-
gary and Romania, as well as detections 
of migrants between Greece and Italy, will 
remain dependent on the volume of illegal 
border-crossing on the Eastern Mediter-
ranean route.
The risk of facilitation of secondary move-
ments is also linked to the risk of border-
control authorities being faced with the 
flow of people in search of international 
protection.
6. Risk of less effective border 
control due to changing operational 
environment
At the horizon of 2013, the operational en-
vironments of border control are likely to 
be affected, on the one hand, by austerity 
measures reducing resources, and on the 
other hand, by increased passenger flows 
triggering more reliance on technological 
equipment.
Austerity measures have been introduced 
throughout Member States in various forms 
since 2009. The most obvious examples are 
found in Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain 
and the Baltic countries. These measures 
could result in increasing disparities be-
tween Member States in their capacity to 
perform border controls and hence enabling 
facilitators to select border types and sec-
tions that are perceived as weaker in de-
tecting specific modi operandi.
Budget cuts could also exacerbate the prob-
lem of corruption, increasing the vulnera-
bility to illegal activities across the external 
borders.
Austerity measures will inevitably impact on 
the efficacy of border-control authorities in 
detecting and preventing a wide array of il-
legal activities at the borders, ranging from 
illegal border-crossing through smuggling 
of excise goods to THB. 
Border-crossing points with large flows of 
passengers – mostly at the air border and 
along the eastern land borders – increas-
ingly rely on technology to support the 
border controls. This clearly has advan-
tages such as increasing detection rates of 
known cases of fraudulent entry, but the 
Frontex · annual risk analysis 2012 
42 of 60
decreasing importance of human interven-
tions increases the risk of a new modus op-
erandi to pass undetected and reduces the 
possibility to collect human intelligence.
As reported by Member States, it also in-
creases the likelihood of criminal groups 
relying on classical techniques to target 
less-equipped border-crossing points such 
as small airports.
7. Risk of abuse of new legal travel 
channels to enter and sub-sequent 
illegal stay in the EU
The increase in the number of air and over-
land passengers, and rising global mobility 
will increase the number of border checks. 
Visa liberalisation and local border-traf-
fic agreements are also being increasingly 
implemented or planned. As a result, the 
responsibilities and workloads of border- 
control authorities are also increasing.
The purpose of visa liberalisation is to facil-
itate people-to-people contacts, enhance 
business opportunities and cultural ex-
change, and to offer opportunities in the 
EU to the people of the given region/coun-
try. These objectives implicitly entail in-
creases in passenger flows, translating into 
an increased workload for border-control 
authorities. In turn, this places additional 
stress on border-control authorities to pre-
vent irregular migration especially in terms 
of preventing overstaying. 
It also carries an increasing risk of docu-
ment fraud, as migrants willing to enter 
the EU illegally seek to obtain fraudulent 
documents from the third countries ben-
efiting from visa liberalisation.
In addition, the numbers of cases of asy-
lum abuse by the five visa-exempt national-
ities of the Western Balkans, mostly Serbia 
and the former Yugoslav Republic of Mac-
edonia, even if showing signs of decreases 
compared to their peak in 2011, are likely 
to persist at a level higher than it was the 
case prior to visa liberalisation. 
8. Risk of border-control authorities 
increasingly confronted with cross-
border crimes and travellers with the 
intent to commit crime or terrorism 
within the EU
As a corollary to strengthened surveillance 
and checks along the external borders, bor-
der-control authorities will be increasingly 
confronted with the detection of cross-bor-
der crimes such as THB, drug trafficking and 
the smuggling of excise goods, as well as 
with detections of cross-border crime com-
mitted on exit, like the smuggling of stolen 
assets, in particular vehicles.
The Eastern Mediterranean route across 
the external borders with Turkey remains 
the main channel of entry of heroin into 
the EU. The Western Balkan route is also 
often used as at transit region for hashish 
and heroin held by Western Balkan crim-
inal groups. There is an increasing risk of 
hashish and cocaine trafficking activity in 
the Western Mediterranean area, from Mo-
rocco to Spain, sometimes combined with 
the smuggling of migrants. These groups 
are operating with increasingly sophis-
ticated means, such as the use of small 
aircraft.
Cigarette smuggling significantly affects the 
work of border authorities on the eastern 
land border and the land borders with West-
ern Balkan countries. It is also increasingly 
reported at sea and air borders. The modi 
operandi range from ‘ant’ smuggling car-
ried by individuals to large-sale enterprises. 
The detection of cigarette smuggling con-
sumes time and resources of border con-
trol authorities.

Trafficking of oil products is mainly reported 
at the eastern European borders with the 
Russian Federation, Belarus and Ukraine, 
as well as with Balkan states. Even though 
petrol smuggling is commonly believed to 
have only a limited and local impact on the 
EU economy, fuel smugglers present a chal-
lenge to the management of the movement 
of passengers at the borders.
Stolen vehicle identification is mainly linked 
to the control at land borders and, to a lesser 
extent, sea borders. Intelligence received 
from Member States also indicates an in-
crease in trafficking of stolen vehicles leav-
ing the EU at the external borders between 
Bulgaria and Turkey, and also an increase in 
stolen heavy vehicles, machines, buses and 
trailers detected at the external land bor-
ders with Belarus and Ukraine.
Given the sophistication of the modus oper-
andi, the detection of stolen vehicles relies 
mostly on the profiling of drivers and exper-
tise in vehicle identification technique, hence 
the collaboration between law-enforce-
ment authorities operating in the territory 
and border-control authorities is extremely 
important.
THB is not easily detected at the borders. 
Nevertheless, this criminal activity is ines-
capably related to the movement of peo-
ple, including movement across borders, 
and thus border-control authorities’ efforts 
can prove instrumental in combating it. Ac-
cording to information received from Mem-
ber States, Brazilians, Chinese, Nigerians, 
Ukrainians and Vietnamese remain among 
the nationalities most commonly detected 
as victims of human trafficking in the EU.
A worrying trend is the increasing detec-
tions of illegal border-crossing of minors and 
pregnant women, in particular along the 
Western Mediterranean route, as criminal 
groups are taking advantage of immigration 
legislation in Member States preventing the 
return of these two groups of migrants. Al-
though it is not clear whether these cases 
are related to THB, women and children are 
clearly among the most vulnerable.
There is an intelligence gap on terrorist 
groups that are active in the EU and their 
connections with irregular-migration net-
works. The absence of strategic knowledge 
on this issue at the EU level may constitute 
a vulnerability for internal security. Knowl-
edge gained at the external borders can be 
shared with other law enforcement au-
thorities to contribute narrowing this gap.

Indicator 5 – Applications for international protection (asylum applications): 
The number of third-country nationals having submitted an application for international protection or having been included in 
such an application (e.g. as a family member) during the reference month (see Article 4.1 of Regulation (EC) No 862/2007 of 
11 July 2007). Each applicant for international protection must be recorded only once within the same reference month. This 
indicator concerns applications submitted to Member State authorities at the external border as well as applications submitted 
inside the territory. It is the number of new applications which have been submitted exclusively during the reporting month (in 
contrast to the total number of applications under consideration in a country at a certain time). It should include all applications 
for international protection such as for refugee status, subsidiary or temporary protection, etc. This indicator should not include 
EU or Schengen Associated Country (SAC) nationals.

Indicator 6 – Persons using false travel documents for entering the territory illegally: 
The number of persons who were detected by Member State authorities during border checks at BCPs who attempted to use 
false travel documents, false visas or false permissions to stay for the purpose of entering the territory. All cases of falsifications 
(forged, counterfeit, substitution of photo or name, fantasy documents, etc.) have to be included. The category concerns only 
those persons who used false passports, identity cards, residence or work permits, visas, etc., i.e. types of documents of which 
genuine versions would be valid for entering. Cases in which other types of documents have been used, such as false driving 
licences, false boarding passes or false supporting documents should not be included in this category. This indicator should 
include third-country nationals as well as EU and Schengen Associated Country (SAC) nationals.

Indicator 7B – Third-country nationals effectively returned to third countries: 
The number of third-country nationals returned from the territory of a Member State to a third country during the 
reporting month, either through voluntary departure or by forced return (removal). All cases included in this number have 
to be 1) either the consequence of an administrative or judicial decision or act stating or declaring that the stay of the 
third-country national was illegal and subject to an obligation to leave the territory of the Member State or 2) if a Member 
State makes use of the derogation provided for by Article 2(2) (b) of the Return Directive (e.g. the consequence of a return 
decision/order issued in accordance with national law). This indicator should not include EU nationals or third-country 
nationals returned to an EU Member State or a Schengen Associated Country (SAC).

The term Member States refers to FRAN 
Member States, which includes the 27 EU 
Member States and the three Schengen 
Associated Countries (Iceland, Norway and 
Switzerland). For the data concerning de-
tections at the external borders of the EU, 
some of the border types are not applica-
ble to all FRAN Member States. This per-
tains to data on all FRAN indicators since 
the data are provided disaggregated by 
border type. The definitions of detections 
at land borders are therefore not applica-
ble (excluding borders with non-Schen-
gen principalities) for Belgium, the Czech 
Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Ice-
land, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the 
Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Switzer-
land and the UK. For Cyprus, detections at 
the Green Line demarcation with the area 
where the Government of the Republic of 
Cyprus does not exercise effective control 
have been assimilated into total detections 
at the EU external  land border. For sea bor-
ders, the definitions are not applicable for 
land-locked Member States including Aus-
tria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxem-
bourg, Slovakia and Switzerland.
In addition, data on detections of illegal bor-
der-crossing at land, air and sea BCPs (1B) are 
not available for Iceland, Ireland and Spain, 
and in Greece these detections are included 
in the data for indicator 1A. Data for Nor-
way only include detections of illegal bor-
der-crossing at land and sea BCPs (1B), not 
between BCPs (1A).
In Italy, detections of illegal border-crossing 
at sea BCPs are only reported for intra-EU 
border-crossing from Greece. Data on de-
tections of illegal border-crossing between 
sea BCPs (1A) are not available for Ireland.
Data on apprehension (FRAN Indicator 2) of 
facilitators is not available for Ireland. For It-
aly, the data are not disaggregated by border 
type, but are reported as total apprehen-
sions (not specified). Data for Italy and Nor-
way also include the facilitation of illegal stay 
and work. For Romania, the data include 
land Intra-EU detections on exit at the bor-
der with Hungary.
For the data concerning detections of ille-
gal stay (FRAN Indicator 3), data on detec-
tions on exit are not available for Denmark, 
Ireland, Italy, Spain and the UK. For Greece, 
only detections of illegal stayers with false 
documents are reported at the air border as 
detections of illegal stay on exit.
Data on refusals of entry (FRAN Indicator 4) 
at the external EU borders are not disaggre-
gated by reason of refusal for Ireland and the 
UK. Refusals of entry at the Spanish land 
borders at Ceuta and Melilla (without the 
issuance of a refusal form) are reported sep-
arately and are not included in the presented 
FRAN data.
The data on applications for international 
protection (FRAN Indicator 5) are not dis-
aggregated by place of application (type of 
border on entry or inland applications) for 
Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovenia. For 
these countries, only the total number of ap-
plications is reported. For France, only asy-
lum applications at the external borders are 
reported, not inland applications. For Swit-
zerland, requests for asylum at the Swiss 
embassies abroad are also reported and con-
sidered as inland applications in the FRAN 
data. For the UK, data reported for appli-
cations at air BCPs also include applications 
at sea BCPs.
For Ireland, data on persons using false doc-
uments are only available from February 2011 
(FRAN Indicator 6). In Sweden, the data on 
false document use are not presented since 
the reported detections do not distinguish 
between apprehensions of persons using 
false documents at the external border and 
those apprehended inland.
