          Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training, operations
          and research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. The Annual Risk Analysis and
          other risk analysis publications bear a triangular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a
          triangle, with a dot at the centre. Metaphorically, the arrow represents the cyclical nature
          of risk analysis processes and its orientation towards an appropriate operational response.
          The triangle is a symbol of ideal proportions and knowledge, reflecting the pursuit of
          factual exactness, truth and exhaustive analysis. The dot at the centre represents the
          intelligence factor and the focal point where information from diverse sources converges
          to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical products. Thus, Frontex risk analysis
          is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable basis for its operational activities.

           The smuggling of excise goods is a diverse
           phenomenon related to the customs regu-
           lations in place in both the bordering coun-
           tries and the price gaps existing between
           particular goods. The most common ex-
           cise goods smuggled across the external
           border of the EU are cigarettes and pe-
           troleum products.                                                            Figure 13: In Poland, border-control

Visa Information System – the technical background

Visa Information System consists of three main building blocks: a central database, a national in-
terface in each Schengen state, and a communication infrastructure between the central database
and the national interfaces. This system architecture enables competent authorities of the Schen-
gen States to process data on visa applications and on all visas that are issued, annulled, refused,
revoked or extended.

The Visa Information System central database has alphanumerical searching capabilities for check-
ing the veracity of a given visa sticker number aided by a system (AFIS) that compares new finger-
prints against those in the database and returns hit/no hit responses, along with matches.

Currently, the central database is located in France (Strasbourg) and a back-up, capable of ensuring
all functionalities is located in Austria (Sankt Johann im Pongau). By the end of 2012, the Agency
for the management of large-scale IT systems in the area of justice, freedom and security will
become the Managing Authority of VIS.

Unfounded asylum applications from the Western Balkans continued at lower levels in 2011

In 2011 the overall number of asylum applications made by nationals from the five visa-exempt West-
ern Balkan countries (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Mac-
edonia and Montenegro) in all the Member States decreased by roughly one quarter compared to
2010. Nevertheless, the numbers still remained relatively high at slightly more than 9% of all asy-
lum applications submitted in the EU (down from a 14% share recorded in 2010).

Despite more than a 30% decrease compared to 2010, Serbian nationals continued to be the sin-
gle largest visa-exempt nationality claiming asylum in the EU during 2011. Serbs remained the
second-ranked nationality (after Afghans) of asylum applicants in the EU.

Indicator 5 – Applications for international protection (asylum applications):
The number of third-country nationals having submitted an application for international protection or having been included in
such an application (e.g. as a family member) during the reference month (see Article 4.1 of Regulation (EC) No 862/2007 of
11 July 2007). Each applicant for international protection must be recorded only once within the same reference month. This
indicator concerns applications submitted to Member State authorities at the external border as well as applications submitted
inside the territory. It is the number of new applications which have been submitted exclusively during the reporting month (in
contrast to the total number of applications under consideration in a country at a certain time). It should include all applications
for international protection such as for refugee status, subsidiary or temporary protection, etc. This indicator should not include
EU or Schengen Associated Country (SAC) nationals.

           The number of persons who were detected by Member State authorities during border checks at BCPs who attempted to use
           false travel documents, false visas or false permissions to stay for the purpose of entering the territory. All cases of falsifications

           those persons who used false passports, identity cards, residence or work permits, visas, etc., i.e. types of documents of which
