Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training, operations and 
research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis publications bear a trian-
gular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with a dot at the centre. Metaphorically, 
the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk analysis processes and its orientation towards an 
appropriate operational response. The triangle is a symbol of ideal proportions and knowledge, 
reflecting the pursuit of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive analysis. The dot at the centre 
represents the intelligence factor and the focal point where information from diverse sources 
converges to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical products. Thus, Frontex risk 
analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable basis for its operational activities.

Executive summary
In 2014, detections of illegal border-cross-
ing reached a new record, with more than 
280  000 detections. The unprecedented 
number of migrants crossing illegally the 
external borders has roots in the fighting in 
Syria that has resulted in the worst refugee 
crisis since the Second World War. Indeed, 
most of the detections at the borders con-
cerned migrants from Syria, who later ap-
plied for asylum within the EU.
The record number of migrants detected at 
the external borders of the EU had several 
implications for border-control authorities 
and EU internal security:
1)  Most of these detections were reported 
as part of search and rescue operations in 
the Central Mediterranean area. In 2014, 
border-control authorities saved the lives 
of thousands of people. However, facili-
tators increasingly utilised unsafe boats, 
with the inevitable result that migrants’ 
lives were put at risk. 
2)  The very high demand for illegal crossing 
to the EU, fuelled by the record number of 
successful entries, also led to a new modus 
operandi. Since September 2014, the use of 
large cargo ships to transport migrants di-
rectly from the Turkish coast near Mersin 
to Italy has been reported. This is a multi-
million-euro business for organised crime 
groups (OCG), which is likely to be repli-
cated in other departure countries. Another 
worrying trend has been the increasing 
number of deliberate attempts to involve 
merchant ships in rescuing migrants. This 
has prompted the International Maritime 
Organization (IMO) to voice the concerns 
of the shipping industry over its involve-
ment in rescuing irregular migrants.
3)  With record numbers of migrants cross-
ing the border illegally, resources are de-
voted to their immediate care, rather 
than screening and obtaining informa-
tion on their basic characteristics such as 
nationality. After they are rescued, they 
continue their journey to other Member 
States and not knowing who is travelling 
within the EU is a vulnerability for EU in-
ternal security.
The profile of detected irregular migrants 
remained relatively unchanged compared 
to 2013, being mostly adult males. However, 
the proportion of women (11%) and children 
(15%) reflects the fact that many migrants 
move to the EU with the intention of claim-
ing asylum, thereby escaping violence in their 
own country.
Most migrants were detected in the Cen-
tral Mediterranean area, where detections 
totalled over 170 000. On the Eastern Med-
iterranean route detections totalled over 50 
800. Towards the end of 2014, detections 
sharply increased at the Hungarian land bor-
der with Serbia, making the Western Bal-
5 of 68
kan route (with 43 357 detections) the third 
most important irregular migration route 
towards the EU.
Detections of clandestine entry in vehicles in-
creased strongly from 599 in 2013 to 3 052 in 
2014. This rise was due to a tenfold increase in 
detections reported from the Bulgarian BCPs 
along the land border with Turkey.
In 2014, there were just over 9 400 detections 
of document fraud cases on entry to the EU/
Schengen area from third countries, which 
represented a slight decrease compared to 
the previous year. By contrast, cases reported 
on intra-EU Schengen movements showed a 
marked increase from 7 867 in 2013 to 9 968 
in 2014 (+27%). Thus, for the first time, there 
were more fraudulent documents detected 
on intra-EU/Schengen movements than dur-
ing border checks on passengers arriving from 
third countries. This is partly due to the large 
number of migrants undertaking secondary 
movements within the EU, often with fraud-
ulent documents obtained in the country of 
their entry into the EU. 
The facilitation of illegal migration remains 
a significant threat to the EU external bor-
ders. Detections of facilitators rose from 
7 252 in 2013 to 10 234 in 2014. The increase 
was mostly due to higher numbers reported 
in Spain, Italy and Bulgaria.
Member States reported more than 114 000 
refusals of entry issued at the external bor-
ders of the EU, a decrease of 11% compared 
to 2013. The decrease is the consequence of 
the record high of 2013, when an exception-
ally large number of Russians of Chechen or-
igin were refused entry because they lacked 
a valid visa. 
In 2014, there were 441 780 detections of il-
legal stay in the EU, which represents an in-
crease compared to the year before. Most 
of the increase was due to a higher number 
of detected Syrians and Eritreans who later 
applied for asylum.
A total of 252 003 third-country nationals 
were subject to an obligation to leave the 
EU as a result of an administrative or judi-
cial decision, which was a 12% increase com-
pared to 2013. 
In 2014, there were 161 309 third-country na-
tionals effectively returned to countries out-
side the EU, which was broadly similar to 
the numbers returned in 2013. The UK was 
the Member State that conducted the larg-
est number of returns (36 313), with steady 
trends to India and Pakistan. Greece reported 
an increase in effective returns, mostly of 
Albanians.
As regards the wider geopolitical context, 
two issues clearly stand out: the conflict in 
Syria and the continued volatility in North Af-
rican countries, notably Libya, from where mi-
grants often depart in their attempt to cross 
the Mediterranean Sea. The large number 
of displaced Syrians in the Middle East and 
North Africa suggests that Syria will likely re-
main the top country of origin for irregular 
migrants and asylum seekers in the EU for 
some time to come. In Libya, migrants are 
in an extremely vulnerable situation, espe-
cially those in areas affected by the fighting. 
Migrants in Libya also face arbitrary deten-
tion and very poor conditions of detention, 
marked by overcrowding, poor sanitation 
and exploitation.
The ongoing crisis in Ukraine will continue 
to be an important factor affecting popula-
tion movements. However, so far it has not 
resulted in marked changes in illegal migra-
tion movements towards the EU. The main 
development along the eastern land border 
has been the reduction in the number of reg-
ular passengers from the Russian Federation 
to the EU due to the economic downturn.
Frontex · annual risk analysis 2015

Looking ahead, the likelihood of a large num-
ber of illegal border-crossings to the EU is 
high and so is the probability of a large num-
ber of migrants needing assistance in terms 
of search and rescue operations (but also the 
provision of international protection), in par-
ticular in the southern section of the external 
border, on the Eastern Mediterranean  and 
the Central Mediterranean routes. Many mi-
grants who cross illegally and apply for asylum 
are not detained and thus continue making 
their journey within the EU.
Most risks associated with document fraud 
were assessed as high. Indeed, document 
fraudsters not only undermine border secu-
rity but also the internal security of the EU. 
These risks are common to nearly all Member 
States, as they are associated with passenger 
flows and border checks, which are a spe-
cific expertise of border-control authorities. 
Most cases of fraud are expected to involve 
EU travel documents and there are indica-
tions of a shift away from the use of pass-
ports towards less sophisticated documents 
such as ID cards and residence permits.
Overall, there is an underlying threat of ter-
rorism-related travel movements especially 
due to the appeal of the Syrian conflict to both 
idealist and radicalised youths. The conflict in 
Syria has attracted hundreds of foreign fight-
ers, including EU citizens, dual-nationality 
holders and other third-country nationals.

The Frontex Annual Risk Analysis (ARA) 2015 
presents a European summary of trends and 
developments along the external borders of 
the Member States of the EU. This analysis 
is based on information provided to Frontex 
by the EU Member States and Schengen As-
sociated countries throughout 2014, as well 
as information collected during Frontex Joint 
Operations and from open sources.
The analysis starts with an overview of the 
situation before the border based on data for 
Schengen uniform visas. It then looks at the 
situation along the external border, based on 
trends in regular passenger flows, detections 
of illegal border-crossing, clandestine entries 
and refusals of entry. Finally, the report pro-
vides an update on the situation regarding 
persons staying illegally in the EU and third-
country nationals returned.
Frontex operational activities aim at strength-
ening border security by ensuring the coor-
dination of Member States’ actions in the 
implementation of Community measures 
relating to the management of the external 
borders. The coordination of operational ac-
tivities also contributes to better allocation 
of Member States’ resources and protection 
of the area of freedom, security and justice.
The ARA 2015 concentrates on the current 
scope of Frontex operational activities, which 
focus on irregular migration at the external 
borders of EU Member States and Schengen 
Associated Countries. In line with the con-
cept of integrated border management (IBM), 
border management should not be limited to 
controlling illegal migration but also cover 
threats to the EU internal security. Thus a full 
section is dedicated to the analysis of cross-
border crime.
The Frontex Risk Analysis Unit (RAU) would 
like to express its gratitude to all members 
of the Frontex Risk Analysis Network (FRAN) 
in Member States for their efforts in provid-
ing data and information, as well as Europol, 
EASO and the WHO PHAME programme, 
which have contributed to the ARA 2015, and 
all Frontex colleagues involved in the prepa-
ration of this report.
1. Introduction
Frontex · annual risk analysis 2015
8 of 68
Data exchange
A coherent and full analysis of the risks af-
fecting security at the external borders re-
quires, above all, the adoption of common 
indicators. Consistent monitoring of these 
indicators will then allow effective measures 
to be taken on the ground. 
The backbone of the ARA 2015 is the monthly 
statistics exchanged among Member States 
within the framework of the Frontex Risk 
Analysis Network (FRAN). This regular data-
exchange exercise was launched in Septem-
ber 2007 and then refined in 2008. Thanks to 
FRAN members’ efforts, a much larger statis-
tical coverage was achieved in 2011. Additional 
requirements were added in 2014, and active 
collaboration with EASO means that their 
data on asylum applications are now privi-
leged over data collected through the FRAN. 
Thus, for the ARA 2015, the key indicators col-
lected through FRAN were: detections of ille-
gal border-crossing through the green border 
or at BCPs; refusals of entry; detections of ille-
gal stay; detections of facilitators; detections 
of forged documents; return decisions and 
effective returns; and passenger flow (when 
available). Data on asylum applications are still 
being collected within the FRAN, but increas-
ingly Frontex relies on data collected by EASO 
to analyse the situation regarding asylum.
Data on the number of EU visas issued and 
their places of issue would improve the char-
acterisation of third-country passenger flows. 
However, this information, which is collected 
within the Council’s Visa Working Party and 
published by the European Commission, is 
not yet available for 2014. For the purpose 
of the ARA, data from 2008 to 2013 are dis-
cussed as an introduction to the general sit-
uation at the borders. 
Member States were not requested to an-
swer specific questions in support of this 
analysis. Rather, bi-monthly analytical reports 
and incident reports of Member States rou-
tinely collected within the FRAN were used 
as important sources of information, espe-
cially as regards the analysis of routes and 
modi operandi.
Open-source information was also effectively 
exploited, especially in identifying the main 
push and pull factors for irregular migration to 
the EU. Among others, these sources included 
reports issued by government agencies, in-
ternational and non-governmental organisa-
tions, as well as official EU reports, such as 
the European Commission’s reports on third 
countries, and mainstream news agencies.
In addition, Frontex organised an Annual An-
alytical Review to consolidate the risk anal-
yses presented in the FRAN Quarterlies for 
2014 and also to gather knowledge on likely 
risks of irregular migration at the EU’s exter-
nal borders. Participants of the FRAN were 
invited in January 2015 to review and com-
ment on the risks identified at the external 
borders during a one-day exercise.
2. Methodology © Frontex, 2014
9 of 68
The data exchange was overseen by Frontex 
involving national border-control authorities. 
Data were categorised by border type (land, 
air and sea) and those on land borders were 
additionally categorised by border section 
with neighbouring third countries.
The data exchanged within the FRAN are 
compiled and analysed on a quarterly basis. 
Priority is given to the use of data for man-
agement purposes and to its fast sharing 
among Member State border-control au-
thorities. Member States’ data processed by 
Frontex are not treated as official statistics 
and thus may occasionally vary from those 
officially published by national authorities.
Throughout 2014, some FRAN members per-
formed backdated updates of their 2013 sta-
tistics. These updates have been accounted 
for in this document and so some data pre-
sented herein may differ from the data pre-
sented a year ago in the Annual Risk Analysis 
2014.
External borders refer to the borders be-
tween Member States and third countries. 
The borders, if any, between the Schengen 
Associated Countries (Liechtenstein, Norway, 
Iceland and Switzerland) and third countries 
are also considered as external borders. The 
borders between the Schengen Associated 
Countries and Schengen Member States are 
considered as internal borders. For indicators 
on detections of facilitators, illegal stay and 
asylum, statistics are also reported for de-
tections at the land borders, if any, between 
the Schengen Member States and Member 
States not yet part of the Schengen area (Bul-
garia, Romania, Croatia, Cyprus) or Member 
States that have opted-out from Schengen 
(the UK, Ireland), so that a total for EU Mem-
ber States and Schengen Associated Coun-
tries as a whole can be presented. It was not 
possible to make this distinction for air and 
sea borders because Member States do not 
habitually differentiate between extra-EU 
and intra-EU air and sea connections but tend 
to aggregate data for all arrivals per airport.
Quality of available data
Consistent with other law-enforcement in-
dicators, variations in administrative data 
related to border control depend on several 
factors. In this case, the number of detections 
of illegal border-crossing and refusals of en-
try are both functions of the amount of ef-
fort spent detecting irregular migrants and 
the actual flow of irregular migrants to the 
EU. For example, increased detections of il-
legal border-crossing might be due to a real 
increase in the flow of irregular migrants 
or may in fact be an outcome of more re-
sources made available to detect them. In 
exceptional cases, increased resources may 
produce a rise in reported detections while 
effectively masking an actual decrease in the 
flow of migrants, resulting from a strong de-
terrent effect.
Information on national-level resources for 
border-control authorities and their allocation 
is currently only partially known by Frontex. 
These data are provided by Member States 
themselves either within the Schengen eval-
uation mechanism or within the External 
Borders Fund (EBF) reporting. Without sys-
tematic and reliable information on resources 
allocated to border control and without es-
timates of irregular migration flows, it is not 
possible to assess the performance and im-
pact of the border controls put in place and 
the analyses of the situation at the EU’s ex-
ternal borders are limited to descriptive sta-
tistics of the administrative data provided by 
Member States.
Application of the Common Integrated 
Risk Analysis Model (CIRAM)
A key development in the CIRAM 2.0 up-
date released in 2011 was the adoption of a 
management approach to risk analysis that 
Frontex · annual risk analysis 2015
10 of 68
defines risk as a function of the threat, vul-
nerability and impact. Such an approach en-
deavours to reflect the spirit of the Schengen 
Borders Code and the Frontex Regulation, 
both of which emphasise risk analysis as a 
key tool in ensuring the optimal allocation of 
resources within the constraints of budget, 
staff and efficiency of equipment.

3.1.  Passenger flow across the 
external borders
Passenger flow is highly correlated with the 
volumes of checks that border guards have 
to perform at the BCPs. The composition and 
volume of passenger flow determine to a 
large extent the planning and allocation of 
resources that will be needed.
At a European level, there is no systematic 
reporting on passenger flows by BCP, bor-
der section or as a total for the EU’s external 
border. Some external indicators can be used 
to raise awareness on the trend, like growth 
in air traffic movements, tickets sold by ferry 
companies, and the like. However, these ex-
ternal indicators are insufficient to properly 
and rapidly highlight the trend. Despite these 
shortcomings, some initiatives are being de-
veloped, such as the Smart Borders Package 
currently in the pilot phase. Hopefully, this 
may lead to the roll-out of an EU Entry/Exit 
System that will remedy this lack of reliable 
data. In parallel, Frontex and Member States, 
under the Frontex Risk Analysis Network 
(FRAN), have started to report passenger 
flow on a monthly basis. This initiative is still 
in its infancy, and the data collection is done 
on a voluntary basis (13 Member States did 
not report any monthly data for 2014). Nev-
ertheless, this reporting should shed some 
light on the broad characteristics of passen-
ger flows across the external borders.
At the macro level, since 2008 two factors have 
contributed to significant changes in passen-
ger flow: the first one was the economic crisis 
that translated into a decrease in passenger 
flow in 2009–2010, in particular at the air bor-

der. The second was the visa liberalisation pol-
icy and local border traffic agreements that 
resulted in higher passenger flows, mostly at 
the land borders with Western Balkan coun-
tries, especially at the Hungarian land border 
with Serbia, i.e. along the main road connec-
tion of the Western Balkans to the EU. Even 
though the lack of passenger flow data does 
not warrant the comparison of flows at the 
land and air borders, since 2010, refusals of en-
try have been larger at the land borders than 
at the air borders, which suggests a heavier 
workload at the former type of border.

At the air borders, Member State border-con-
trol authorities do not collect data on pas-
sengers going through border checks in a 
systematic way. Some Member States have 
national Entry-Exit systems in place that re-
cord the number and nationality of the pas-
sengers in detail, but most Member States 
do not directly collect detailed statistics but 
rely on information provided by air carriers 
(flight manifests and/or API transmissions). 
At the air border, data from Eurostat on ex-
tra-EU arrivals are the best approximation of 
the flow of passengers, but this flow does not 
correspond to the total flow of passengers 
going through border checks as it does not 
take into account the flow between Schen-
gen and non-Schengen Member States.
Eurostat annual totals for 2014 are not yet 
available but earlier data can also provide 
some valuable insights (see Fig.  1). In 2013 
compared to 2012 the increase in arrivals 
requiring border checks (arrivals from third 
countries, as well as between Schengen and 
non-Schengen Member States and between 
non-Schengen Member States) was more 
pronounced (+20%) than in the case of ar-
rivals not requiring any checks (+9%, within 
Schengen Member States). This means that 
border-control authorities saw their work-
load at airports considerably increasing in 
2013. The rising trend in passenger flow is

mostly due to the growing passenger flow 
on major air routes.
Third-country airports of departure to 
the EU
The USA remains the main departure third 
country for arrivals in the EU, represent-
ing 19% of all arrivals from third countries 
in 2013 (with about 27 million passengers), 
yet the largest increase was observed for 
arrivals from Turkey: from about 16 mil-
lion in 2012 to nearly 20 million in 2013 
(+25%). In fact, two Turkish airports, Istan-
bul (more than 7 million arrivals) and the 
leisure airport Antalya (6.5 million arrivals), 
are in the top three airports for arrivals in 
the EU. The largest absolute increase be-
tween 2012 and 2013 was reported for ar-
rivals from Dubai airport, which increased 
from 5.6 million in 2012 to nearly 7 million 
in 2013 (+25%).
Arrivals from the Russian Federation (mostly 
from Moscow Sheremetyevo airport) have 
also constantly increased since 2009, to reach 
a record high in 2013 with 11 million arrivals, 
but this trend is expected to stop in 2014, be-
cause of the economic downturn in the Rus-
sian Federation and the depreciation of the 
rouble against the euro which have a negative 
impact on numbers of travellers to the EU.
Land borders
Information available on passenger traffic at 
the external land borders of the EU is scarce. 
Under FRAN data collection scheme on pas-
senger flow, ten Member States reported 
data on passenger flow at their land bor-
der on a monthly basis in 2014. Information 
for some of the busiest land borders is still 
missing, notably at the Bulgarian and Greek 
land border with Turkey, and at the Croatian 
border with Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia.
In 2014, the ten Member States reporting 
data on passenger flow together totalled 
about 50 million arrivals at the land bor-
ders. The traffic was the heaviest at the 
borders with the Russian Federation (Nor-
way, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), 
with about 13 million passengers. On an an-
nual basis, passenger flow from Ukraine fol-
lowed. However, through the year, these two 
flows showed diverging trends, with passen-
ger flow from the Russian Federation de-
creasing and passenger flow from Ukraine 
slightly increasing.
Indeed, passenger flow sharply dropped at 
all border sections with the Russian Federa-
tion after August 2014, as a consequence of 
the economic downturn in the Russian Fed-
eration and the depreciation of the rouble 
against the euro. This makes any purchase 
in the EU much less accessible for Russian 
customers. On the other hand, this situa-
tion is likely to favour the growth of petty 
smuggling across the border. Indeed, wider 
price difference in the rouble for products 
like cigarettes will make it more attrac-
tive for Russian smugglers to export ille-
gally to the EU.
In terms of nationalities, Ukrainians were 
ranking first for passenger flow. The largest

increase was, however, reported for Moldo-
vans after the introduction of visa liberalisa-
tion regime that entered into force in 2014.
Land BCP check practices and land BCPs 
themselves vary widely. This sets them apart 
from air borders, as airports constitute a 
controlled environment where practices can 
be more easily standardised. Moreover, the 
rate at which traffic flows across land BCPs 
are determined not only by Member States 
but also by the practices of neighbouring 
third countries. Bilateral cooperation is thus 
fundamental to facilitating transit. Unlike at 
the air border, early warnings at land BCPs 
are rarely available, which limits the abil-
ity of border management authorities to 
allocate resources in advance. Finally, land 
borders can be subject to massive or emer-
gency flows, for which contingency plan-
ning is necessary.
3.2. Visas
The Community Code on Visas, which en-
tered into force in April 2010, sets out the 
common requirements for issuing transit 
and short-term visas to enter the terri-
tory of Member States. There are currently 
over 100 nationalities that require a visa to 
enter the EU, covering more than 80% of 
non-EU population of the world. Neverthe-
less, about 1 billion nationals from approxi-
mately 40 third countries do not require an 
EU visa. These include Australia, Canada, 
Japan, New Zealand and the USA. As indi-
cated in the Visa Code, statistical data are 
an important means of monitoring migra-
tory movements and can serve as an effi-
cient management tool.
Generally, a short-stay visa issued by one of 
the Schengen states (visa C) entitles its holder 
to travel throughout the 26 Schengen states 
for up to three months within a six-month 
period. Visas for visits exceeding that pe-
riod remain subject to national procedures. 
The data include visas issued by the Schen-
gen Associated Countries (Iceland, Liech-
tenstein, Norway and Switzerland), but do 
not include those issued by Croatia, Cyprus, 
Romania and Bulgaria, which have not yet 
joined the Schengen area, nor visas issued 
by the UK and Ireland, which are not part of 
the Schengen area.
Data on visa issuance by Member States and 
third countries of issuance are not yet avail-
able for 2014, but the European Commission, 
through its Directorate-General Home Af-
fairs, has released the data for 2013. VIS data 
are collected on the basis of the place of ap-
plication rather than the citizenship of the 
visa applicant. Thus, for instance, applica-
tions made in the Russian Federation do not 
necessarily represent only Russian nationals. 
However, for the purpose of the following 
overview, the country where the visas were 
delivered was used as the most suitable ap-
proximation of the visas issued to citizens of 
that country. Visas broken down by national-
ities are available at the national level, where 
they can be used for operational purposes.
In 2013, a total of 16 196 350 short-term uni-
form visas were issued, representing an in-
crease of 14% compared to 2012. Most of the 
visas (61%) were issued in just three coun-
tries: the Russian Federation, which alone 
accounted for 43% of all visas issued in 2013, 
with almost 7 million visas, as well as Ukraine 
(1.5 million, 9%) and China (1.4 million, 9%). 
There are, however, important differences 
between these three countries in the pur-
pose of travel and frequency of trips. Multi-
ple-entry visas accounted for 49% of all visas 
issued in the Russian Federation, but only for 
13% of those issued in China. Indeed, many 
Chinese applied for short-term visas as part 
of their tourist package in the EU. According 
to the World Tourism Organization, China is 
now the leading nation in terms of tourism 
expenditure worldwide, and this trend will 
further consolidate.

In 2013, the Schengen Member State report-
ing the issuance of most short-term visas was 
France (2.3 million worldwide). For the first 
time, Italy (1.9 million) and Spain (1.89 million) 
issued more visas than Germany (1.85 million).
The granting of visa-free regime to Moldova 
in 2014 considerably increased passenger 
flows, but in contrast to the situation in the 
Western Balkans did not result in an increase 
in asylum applications.
3.3.  Detections of illegal 
border-crossing between 
BCPs
In 2014, detections of illegal border-cross-
ing reached a new record, with more than 
280 000 detections. This was twice as many 
as the previous record of 140 000 detections 
in 2011, the year of the Arab Spring. This un-
precedented number of migrants crossing il-
legally the external border has roots in the 
fighting in Syria that have created the worst 
refugee crisis since the Second World War. In-
deed, most of the detections at the borders 
concern migrants from Syria, who later ap-
plied for asylum within the EU.
The unprecedented number of migrants de-
tected at the external border of the EU had 
several implications for border-control au-
thorities and EU internal security:
1)  Most of these detections were reported as 
part of search and rescue operations in the 
Central Mediterranean area. In 2014, bor-
der-control authorities saved the lives of 
thousands of people. Not all could be saved 
unfortunately, as facilitators have increas-
ingly chartered unsafe boats, stretching 
to the limit the capacities of surveillance 
and rescue.
2)  The very high demand for crossing to the 
EU has also created new modus operandi. 
Since September, there has been an in-
creasing use of large cargo ships to trans-
port migrants directly from the Turkish 
coast near Syria to Italy. This is a multi-mil-
lion-euro business for OCG, which is likely 
to be replicated in other departure coun-
tries. Another worrying trend has been the 
increasing deliberate attempts to involve 
merchant ships to rescue migrants. This 
has prompted the International Maritime 
Organization (IMO) to voice concerns over 
the involvement of the shipping industry 
in rescuing irregular migrants.
3)  With a record level of migrants crossing 
the border illegally, resources are devoted 
to their immediate care, but not towards 
screening and obtaining information on 
basic characteristics like their nationality. 
As migrants quickly continue their jour-
ney to other Member States, increasing 
the movements of persons staying ille-
gally within the EU, this puts the EU in-
ternal security at risk.
Similarly to last year, most of detected mi-
grants were adult men (see Fig. 2). However,

the proportion of women and children re-
flects the fact that most migrants are seek-
ing asylum in the EU, escaping violence in 
their own country.
Indeed, Syrians alone (79  169) represented 
more than a quarter (28%) of the total as 
shown in Figure 3. They were also the top 
nationality for other indicators, in particu-
lar asylum applications, reflecting the dire 
situation in Syria and the desperate plight 
of Syrian asylum seekers. However, the vast 
majority of Syrians did not apply for asylum 
in the Member States of entry but rather in 
other Member States for many different rea-
sons, notably because they expect to receive 
more attractive welfare benefits. 
Regarding Eritreans, their detections in 2014 
reached a record level (more than 34 500, 
compared to 11 300 in 2013). They were mostly 
arriving through Libya on the Central Med-
iterranean route. Like Syrians, they did not 
apply for asylum in the Member States of en-
try, but rather continued to other Member 
States. Many of the Eritreans stated that they 
had lived for some time in Libya but decided 
to leave because of the violence.
Detections of Afghans sharply increased from 
about 9 500 in 2013 to more than 22 000 in 
2014. Afghans were detected on the Eastern 
Mediterranean route (mostly crossing the 
Eastern Aegean Sea), and then once again 
on the Western Balkan route.
Detections of citizens from Kosovo* cross-
ing the land border illegally between Serbia 
and Hungary sharply increased in November 
and December 2014. This trend coincided 
with rumours among Kosovo*’s population 
that it would be now easier to obtain asy-
lum in the EU. By the end of the year their 
detections totalled 22 069.
Routes
n	Central Mediterranean route
In 2014, more than 170 000 migrants ar-
rived irregularly in the EU through the Cen-
tral Mediterranean route (see Fig. 4). As in 
2013 and in 2011, the Central Mediterranean 
route was the main area for illegal border-
crossing into the EU, representing 60% of 
all detections in 2014. Detections were the 
largest between June and September at over 
20 000 per month, but throughout the year, 
monthly detections were larger than in 2013. 
Most migrants were Syrians and Eritreans de-
parting from the Libyan coast.
The vast majority were rescued by border-
control authorities after issuing a distress 
call; however, despite best efforts there were 
many fatalities. Smugglers typically make 
use of frail, overcrowded boats, with limited 
fuel available to maximise their profits, put-
ting migrants’ lives at considerable risk. The 
role of the Italian Navy and the JO Hermes/
Triton was crucial in rescuing an unprece-
dented number of migrants. Despite these 
efforts, around 3 400 people died or went 
missing at sea in 2014 and around 2 800 
since the beginning of July according to UN-
HCR estimates.

Besides naval assets, civilian vessels have 
been increasingly involved in the detection 
and rescue of migrants at sea (see Fig. 5). Ac-
cording to the International Maritime Organ-
ization (IMO), more than 600 merchant ships 
have been diverted from their routes to res-
cue persons at sea in 2014. These deviations 
are, in the words of the Secretary General, 
detrimental to shipping and are not offset 
by any realistic prospects of salvage awards.
In addition to migrants leaving from Libya, 
since September 2014, an increasing number 
of cases have been reported of cargo vessels 
being used to smuggle migrants from Tur-
key directly to Italy. This new trend affects 
the Eastern Mediterranean route, as the de-
parture area, and the Central Mediterranean 
area, as the arrival area. This practice is fur-
ther developed under the section related to 
the Eastern Mediterranean route.

As migrants were rescued in high-sea, they 
were reported as part of the Central Medi-
terranean route. Many were disembarked in 
Apulia and Calabria, to alleviate the burden on 
reception capacity in Sicily. From a statistical 
point of view, these disembarkations artifi-
cially inflated the number of migrants usually 
reported on the Apulia and Calabria route. In 
2014, there were fewer migrants departing 
from Egypt and targeting this area of the Ital-
ian coast than in 2013.
Nationalities
Once rescued, migrants declare their nation-
ality and this information is used to deter-
mine the main countries of origin. Since June 
2014, due to the large number of migrants 
arriving, this information has been either 
slowly or partially reported under the head-
ing ‘sub-Saharan’ for many migrants coming 
from Africa (26 340, or 15% of arrivals in the 
Central Mediterranean in 2014). Migrants’ 
declarations of nationality are also increas-
ingly difficult to validate, as they often lack 
travel documents and, with border-control 
authorities working under increasing pres-
sure there are fewer possibilities to check 
their validity. 
Among the migrants who declared their 
nationalities, Syrians (nearly 40 000) and 
Eritreans (more than 33 500) were by far 
the largest group, together accounting for 
more than 43% of all arrivals in the Central 
Mediterranean.
n	Eastern Mediterranean route
Since data collection began in early 2008, 
the Eastern Mediterranean has maintained 
its status as a hotspot of irregular migra-
tion (see Fig. 6). In 2014, 50 800 detections 
were reported from the area, representing 
18% of the EU total. This was twice as many 
as in 2013, mostly due to a sharp increase in 
detections in the Aegean Sea (from 11 829 in 
2013 to 43 377 in 2014). Detections remained 
comparatively much lower at the Bulgarian 
and Greek land borders with Turkey (12 262 in 
2013 and 5 938 in 2014).
Sea border
Aegean Sea
Compared to the previous year, the sharp in-
crease in the Aegean Sea in 2014 meant that 
migrants departed from more areas, and also 
arrived on a larger number of islands. While 
the islands reporting the largest number of 
arrivals remained Lesbos, Chios and Samos, 
detections were also reported from small is-
lands from North to South, stretching capac-
ity of surveillance. Many migrants claimed 
to be Syrian, and were thus handed an ad-
ministrative notice allowing them to stay in 
Greece for up to six months, even without 
applying for asylum.
Screening processes of some migrants re-
vealed a high degree of falsely claimed na-
tionalities to avoid return. Not knowing the 
nationality of migrants who are illegally 
crossing the border and travelling within 
the EU is evidently a vulnerability for EU in-
ternal security.

The presence of the screening teams also has 
a preventive effect. Migrants aware of being 
screened tend to state their true nationality. 
This could be indirectly established when com-
paring the proportion of migrants reporting to 
be Syrians in islands where screening teams 
were active, with their proportion in islands 
where no screening teams were present. In 
2014, out of the total of 18 662 migrants ar-
riving in Lesbos and Samos, two islands with 
screening teams, 36% declared to be Syrians. By 
contrast, over the same period, out of 14 802 
migrants reported in the islands of Kalymnos, 
Kos, Leros, Limnos, Patmos, Rhodes and Symi, 
seven islands without screening teams, 86% 
declared being from Syria.
Increasing use of cargo ships
Since August 2014 the number of irregular mi-
grants arriving in the Central Mediterranean 
from Turkey sharply increased compared to 
earlier in the year and to the same period in 
2013. This sharp increase was directly related 
to the use of cargo ships to facilitate migrants 
and asylum seekers from Turkey to Italy (for 
example, see Fig. 7).
To date, Mersin has been the place where those 
wishing to travel to the EU in an irregular fash-
ion have made contact with the smuggling 
networks. Wooden boats, however, have de-
parted from various points along south-east-
ern Turkish coast such as Mersin, Adana and 
Hatay provinces to reach cargo vessels wait-
ing off shore.
Smuggling migrants from Turkey on board 
large cargo vessels is extremely profita-
ble, and such funds are likely to be an im-
portant source of income for smuggling 
networks also engaged in other criminal 
activities. This means that the criminal 
networks might be financing other crimi-
nal activities by exploiting and putting at 
risk vulnerable groups of displaced fami-
lies from Syria.

Specifically, the cargo ships, which are of-
ten bought as scrap, tend to cost between 
EUR 150 000 and 400 000. There are often 
as many as 200–800 migrants on board, each 
paying EUR 4 500–6 000 for the trip, either 
in cash a few days before the departure or 
by Hawala payment after reaching the Ital-
ian coast. The cost is high because the modus 
operandi is viewed as being safe and has been 
demonstrated as being successful.
Hence, the gross income for a single journey 
can be as high as EUR 2.5 or even 4 million 
depending on the size of the vessel and the 
number of migrants on board. In some cases, 
the profit is likely to be between EUR 1.5 and 3 
million once other overheads such as recruit-
ers, safe houses, shuttle vessels, crew and fuel 
have been taken into account. Given this level 
of financial gain it is important to act against 
this modus operandi not only to stem the flow 
of irregular migration but also to limit the fi-
nancial assets of the smuggling networks.
Land border
Compared to detection at the sea borders, 
detections at the Bulgarian and Greek land 
border with Turkey have been much lower, 
totalling less than 6 000 detections.
In Bulgaria, as a consequence of increased Bul-
garian operational measures, including an In-
tegrated Border Surveillance System (IBSS) and 
a special police operation, the level of detec-
tions decreased compared to 2013 and tended 
to be mostly reported from the eastern part 
of the border, not covered by the IBSS.
In Greece, while detections at the green border 
and at BCPs were low, some migrants were 
reportedly hiding in vehicles detected on the 
highways inside Greece. Similarly, some inter-
views with migrants conducted in Italy indi-
cated that they had entered illegally without 
being detected at the border. While the re-
liability of these interviews is difficult to as-
certain, they point to the fact that a certain 
proportion of migrants who entered illegally 
went undetected.
n	Western Balkan route
For the second year in a row, detections in 
the Western Balkans strongly increased, from 
6 391 in 2012, to 19 951 in 2013 and 43 357 in 
2014.
The Western Balkan route remained largely 
a function of the transiting flow of migrants 
that enter the EU at the Greek-Turkish bor-
ders and later continue towards other Mem-
ber States through the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia and Serbia. This is 
reflected in the large number of detections 
of Afghans and Syrians at the Hungarian land 
border, whose number increased five-fold 
compared to 2013, like they increased in the 
Aegean Sea.
However, nearly half the detections were cit-
izens of Kosovo*, representing a distinct flow 
of migrants in the Western Balkans. Their 
detections surged from less than 1 000 per 
month before September 2014, to more than 
9 000 in December. This ten times increase 
in a few months is one of the sharpest re-
corded in the FRAN data, comparable to pace 
of the increase in the Central Mediterranean 
that peaked in the summer. This trend could 
partly be attributed to rumours among the 
Kosovo* population that after France decided 
to remove Kosovo* from the national list of 
safe countries it will be much easier to ob-
tain asylum in that Member State.
During 2014 most detected individuals imme-
diately applied for asylum. As a result asy-
lum applications in Hungary mirrored the 
increase in pressure at this border section, 
increasing to unprecedented levels for this 
country – more than 43 000 applications 
submitted in 2014, about half being submit-
ted by Kosovo* citizens. These migrants were

only attempting to cross the green border 
into Hungary, rather than attempting to en-
ter via the BCPs, as there is no indication of 
increased refusals of entry or use of fraudu-
lent documents at any of the BCPs between 
Hungary and Serbia.
Despite the apparently tight relationship be-
tween illegal border-crossing and applications 
for asylum, it is not supposed that all migrants 
crossing this border section immediately ap-
plied for asylum in Hungary, as asylum appli-
cations submitted by citizens of Kosovo* also 
increased in Germany over the same period. 
This means that, for most migrants, Hungary 
is not their final destination and they will con-
tinue their journey through the Schengen area. 
It also means that, to avoid later return to Hun-
gary, migrants will increasingly attempt to 
avoid detection at the border, and only apply 
for asylum in Hungary as a last resort option 
if detected by border-control authorities.
* This designation is 
without prejudice to 
positions on status, and is 
in line with UNSCR 1244 
and the ICJ Opinion on 
the Kosovo declaration of 
independence.

n	 Circular route between Albania and 
Greece
In 2014, Greece reported 8 841 detections 
of illegal border-crossing at its land border 
with Albania and with the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia, of which 8 757 were 
associated with Albanians. This represented 
a stable trend compared to the previous year. 
Prior to visa liberalisation in 2011, detections 
at this border section had ranged between 
38 000 and 30 000 a year.
The introduction of visa liberalisation went 
together with a small increase in refusals of 
entry as more Albanians crossed the border 
at BCPs. However, in 2014 refusals of entry 
decreased at this land border compared to 
2013, probably due to the decreasing flow of 
seasonal workers to Greece. Indeed, many 
Albanians are attempting to travel to other 
Member States than Greece, as reflected in 
their increasing refusals of entry, notably due 
to document fraud, in several Member States. 
These trends may reflect a general migration 
trend for Albanians within the EU.
n	Western Mediterranean route
In 2014 there were 7 842 detections of ille-
gal border-crossing in the Western Medi-
terranean region, which consists of several 
areas of the southern Spanish coast and the 
land borders of Ceuta and Melilla. This total 
shows an increase of 15% compared to the 
total of 6 838 reported in 2013.
Like in 2013, the first half of 2014 showed most 
detections being reported at the land border, 
mostly from Melilla. Indeed, the Spanish au-
thorities reported several violent attempts to 
cross the fence. 
As mitigating measures, the fence has been 
upgraded. As a result, in the second half of 
the year, Spain reported more detections at 
the sea border than at the land border.
Once in Melilla, migrants are turned over to 
Spanish Police Headquarters for identifica-
tion, and many are transferred to the Tem-
porary Centre for Immigrants (CETI – Centro 
de Estancia Temporal de Inmigrantes). How-
ever, this centre only has a limited capacity 
and some migrants had to be transferred to 
mainland Spain.
In terms of nationality, most of the migrants 
are from Western Africa, in particular from 
Cameroon and Mali. Algerians and Moroccans 
have also been reported among the top ten 
nationalities, but mostly at the sea border.
Since November 2014, Spain also reported 
an increase in detections of illegal border-
crossing of Syrians at the land border (more 
than 250 in November and December), then 
applying for asylum. This increase, combin-
ing with increasing detections of Syrians us-
ing forged document to enter to the EU, has 
prompted Spain to open asylum and inter-
national protection offices at the borders of 
Ceuta and Melilla in March 2015.
n	Black Sea route
Detections of illegal border-crossing on the 
Black Sea were extremely rare. However, 
since 2013, Bulgaria and Romania have re-
ported an increasing number of detections, 
totalling 433 migrants in 2014.
These incidents still constitute isolated cases, 
and are possibly linked to the increased sur-
veillance on the Eastern Mediterranean route 
and the increasing number of migrants wait-
ing in Turkey to reach the EU illegally. 
n	Eastern land border route
The eastern land border route is, in effect, 
an amalgam of detections of illegal border-
crossing reported by Finland, Estonia, Latvia, 
Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Ro-
mania. Despite the total length of all the bor-
25 of 68
der sections, detections on this route tend to 
be lower than on other routes, possibly due to 
the long distances between major hubs and 
many countries of origin. Also, according to 
several reports shared during 2014, visa fraud 
and counterfeit border-crossing stamps tend 
to predominate on this route, as opposed to 
detections of illegal border-crossing.
Detections of illegal border-crossing remained 
stable, with 1 275 detections (compared to 
1 316 in 2013). In 2014, most detections were 
reported at the land border between Lithu-
ania and Belarus. Most of these detections 
were of Vietnamese nationals arriving after 
transiting through Belarus.
By contrast to other routes, a large propor-
tions of these detections were connected 
with the smuggling of goods rather than ir-
regular migration. Several Member States 
also mentioned migrants or smugglers cross-
ing the border illegally undetected, but these 
events are believed to be rare.
Detections of illegal border-crossing are also 
kept at low levels along the eastern land 
border thanks to the surveillance efforts of 
neighbouring third countries, in particular 
the Russian Federation and Belarus. Most 
part of the border with Belarus is fenced on 
the Belarusian side.
Regarding the border with Ukraine, Frontex 
monitors the situation, but in 2014 no impor-
tant changes have been noticed. Detections 
for illegal border-crossing remains insignif-
icant along all green border section with 
Ukraine and the number of refusals of en-
try remained comparable to previous years.
3.4. Clandestine entries
Detections of clandestine entry in vehicles 
increased strongly from 599 in 2013 to 3 052 
in 2014. The increase was due to a tenfold 
increase in detections reported from the 
Bulgarian BCPs along the land border with 
Turkey. The increase started in August, pos-
sibly as an indirect consequence of enhanced 
measures at the green border that might have 
caused a partial displacement of the flow 
from green border to BCPs, by way of clan-
destine entries. At the neighbouring Greek 
border section, BCP Kipi, data on clandes-
tine entries is not collected on a systematic 
basis, but detections were much lower than 
at the Bulgarian border (see Fig. 8).
Clandestine hiding in vehicles was also re-
ported in large numbers by Croatia and Hun-
gary at BCPs along their land borders with 
Serbia, as well as on exit from Bulgaria to Ser-
bia in transit to Hungary. The migrants For 
Croatia, 2014 was the first complete year of 
reporting, so comparison with previous year 
are not relevant. However, in Hungary, de-
tections doubled compared to last year, in 
line with increasing pressure at the green 
border. This means that the Hungarian au-
thorities are facing considerable challenges, 
having to deal with larger passenger flow in 
the wake of visa liberalisation in the Western 
Balkans, increased detections of illegal bor-
der-crossing and clandestine entries.
Spain reported 340 clandestine entries in 
2014, at the BCP with Morocco in Melilla. This 
was the first annual report, so comparison 
with previous years is not possible.
Clandestine entry requires migrants to stay 
in confinement for long periods of time, and 
is known to put migrants’ lives at risk of suf-
focation and dehydration. Therefore, most 
of the migrants detected hiding in vehicles 
at BCPs are single young males, rather than 
more vulnerable family groups.
Compared to detections of illegal border-
crossings (283 500), the number of detected 
attempts at clandestine entry (3 052) appears 
very low, in particular considering the large 
volume of vehicle traffic, particularly lorries. 
Frontex · annual risk analysis 2015
26 of 68
It is thus reasonable to assume that detec-
tions underestimate the actual number of 
clandestine entries.
3.5. Document fraud
In 2014 there were just over 9 400 detec-
tions of document fraud cases on entry to 
the EU/Schengen area from third countries, 
which represents a slight decrease compared 
to last year.
The introduction of the new security features 
into travel documents and the development 
of the new automated border-control sys-
tems did not translate into a significant de-
crease in the use of fraudulent documents. 
Fraudsters appear to have changed their modi 
operandi and instead of the simple alterations, 
tend to use more sophisticated methods.
Routes
The air borders remained the border type re-
porting the largest number of detections of 
document fraud in 2014, but on a decreasing 
trend compared to 2013 (-10%).
Considering all detections of fraudulent doc-
uments at the air borders in 2014, Istanbul 
Atatürk (IST) international airport in Turkey 
remained the most reported last embarkation 
airport from third countries, even if the over-
all number of document fraud cases dropped 
down by almost 40% compared to 2013.
Murtala Muhammed (LOS) international air-
port in Lagos, Nigeria remained the second 
most common embarkation point of detected 
document fraudsters. In fact document fraud 
detections on flights to EU/Schengen coun-
tries increased by almost 20%. The major-
ity of document fraudsters were Nigerians.
Other often reported last embarkation air-
ports were located in Brazil, most notably 
Rio de Janeiro (GIG) and Fortaleza (FOR). 
Document fraud from these airports signif-
icantly increased.
For one-third of all detections made at the 
air borders on entry to the EU/Schengen area 
and involving passengers arriving from third 
countries the last embarkation airport was 
unknown (meaning not reported under the 
EDF data collection).
Detections of document fraud at the land 
border increased by 16% between 2013 and 
2014, but remained significantly  smaller than 
at the air borders (see Fig. 10). The increase at 
the land border was driven mainly by a sig-

at the Spanish-Moroccan land border sec-
tion, involving almost exclusively Syrian and 
Moroccan nationals. The detections of Syri-
ans using fraudulent documents to enter the 
EU by land border section between Morocco 
and Spain appeared for the first time in 2014.
Detections of document fraud also increased 
significantly at the land border between Bul-
garia and Turkey (by 30% compared to 2013) 
mostly due to a larger number of detected 
Iraqi nationals. Detections also increased 
(+20%) at the land border between Hungary 
and Serbia, with mostly Serbian, Albanian 
and Kosovo* citizens detected using fraudu-
lent documents at this land border section.
At the sea borders, fewer cases were re-
ported. Almost half of the cases were con-
nected to Moroccan nationals detected in 
Ceuta (Spain).

commonly detected document fraudsters 
across the EU/Schengen area in 2014.
Nigerians continued to rank high for detec-
tions of document fraud, with more than 
500 fraudulent cases in 2014. Most detec-
tions were made after embarkation in Lagos. 
The number of Iraqi nationals involved in doc-
ument fraud more than doubled compared 
to 2013. They were mostly detected flying 
from Fortaleza (Brazil) and Istanbul (Turkey). 
Claimed EU nationals detected with fraudu-
lent documents rose by almost 20% from 945 
fraudulent cases in 2013 to 1 140 fraudulent 
cases in 2014 including all travel types. Most 
detections were made on intra-EU/Schen-
gen movements, often starting on Greek is-
lands but the largest increase, by almost 50% 
compared to 2013, was recorded on entry to 
the EU/Schengen area from third countries.
Travel documents
Fraudulent passports were mostly detected 
on entry from third countries (4 953) followed 
by visas (1 616), residence permits (1 506), ID 
cards (1 414), stamps (1 047) and other docu-
ments (233). The overall decrease compared 
to 2013 was led mainly by the decrease in de-
tections of fraudulent border stamps followed 
by residence permits and visas. The biggest 
increase was recorded in case of fraudulent 
ID cards. Most of the fraudulent documents 
detected on intra-EU/Schengen movements 
were ID cards (5 067) (+30% compared to 
2013). Regarding impostors, most were us-
ing authentic EU passports.
3.6. Refusals of entry
Member States reported a total of more than 
114 000 refusals of entry at the external bor-
ders of the EU, a decrease of 11% compared to 
last year. The decrease is the consequence of

large number of Russians of Chechen origin 
were refused entry due to a lack of visa and 
then applied for asylum in Poland and Ger-
many before overstaying in the EU. This modus 
operandi became less popular in 2014 thanks 
to successful media campaigns supported by 
Germany aimed at quelling the widespread 
rumours in Chechnya that it was possible to 
enter Member States without a visa and eas-
ily receive asylum once there.
As shown in Figure 12, since 2011, more refusals 
of entry were issued at the land border (56%) 
than at the air borders (40%). This is due to 
the increase in passenger flow at land bor-
ders following visa liberalisation in the West-
ern Balkans, and the subsequent increased 
role of border-control authorities in checking 
entry requirements, which was previously the 
responsibility of consular authorities who is-
sued the visa. At the same time, at the air bor-
der most refusals of entry used to be issued to 
citizens of Latin America. However, since this 
region has been enjoying economic growth 
and better employment rate since 2010, there 
has been a decrease in the number of passen-
gers refused entry at the EU’s external border.
Indeed, since 2009 (with the exception of 2013 
when Russians of Chechen origins ranked 
first), most of the persons refused entry at 
EU borders were Ukrainians. Albanians have 
been ranking high since 2011, in the wake of 
the visa liberalisation. In particular, Albani-
ans are now ranking first for refusals of en-
try at the air border. Altogether, citizens of 
Western Balkan countries granted visa-free 
regime accounted for 25% of all refusals of en-
try at the external border, or 28 140 persons.
As in previous years, the main reasons for re-
fusals of entry were the lack of a valid visa 
(30%) and the lack of appropriate documen-
tation justifying the purpose of stay (21%). 
The number of persons refused entry due 
to an alert in the SIS represented only 2% of 
the total, with 2 753 refusals issued in 2014.
3.7. Detections of illegal stay
In 2014, there were 441 780 detections of il-
legal stay in the EU, which represents a gen-
erally increasing trend compared to the year 
before and recent reporting periods. How-
ever, in the following analysis of detections 
of illegal stay it has to be borne in mind that 
the Netherlands, since 2012, due to technical 
reasons, reported only detections on exit and 
not those inland, which in 2011 amounted to 
about 6 000. Also in Sweden, for administra-
tive reasons, many asylum applicants were 
also reported as illegal stayers, raising the 
total number of detections of illegal stay in 
Sweden. Finally, data from Croatia cover the 
whole of 2014, whereas the 2013 data only re-

The vast majority of illegal stayers were de-
tected inland (383 507 detections, or 86% of 
the total) and so are presumed to be long 
term over stayers as they were making no 
attempt to leave at the time of detection. 
The next most common location for detec-
tions of illegal stayers was the air borders 
on exit (33 789 detections) followed by the 
land borders (15 345 detections) where ille-
gally staying migrants were leaving the EU 
or the Schengen area.

In terms of nationalities, the large number of 
Syrians detected staying illegally is artificially 
inflated by detections in Sweden and some 
other Member States as it includes people 
not meeting requirements for staying legally 
before they apply for asylum.
Looking at detections over the past few years, 
Moroccans stand out as one the main na-
tionalities detected staying illegally (above 
20 000 annual detections between 2009 
and 2014), although their detections at the 
external borders remain much lower. This in-
dicates that Moroccans tend to cross the ex-
ternal borders legally, but then exceed their 
legal period of stay within the EU. The same 
applies to Algerians, although in lower num-
ber (above 10 000 annual detections for il-

pared to 2013. The absolute total number of 
migrants subject to return decisions is still 
underestimated by this indicator, as data on 
decisions were unavailable from, inter alia, 
France, the Netherlands and Sweden, which 
only reported effective returns but presum-
ably issued a high number of decisions.
Much of the change between 2013 and 2014 
was due to an increase in return decisions is-
sued by Spain, from 7 410 in 2013 to 40 386 in 
2014. This increase in the number of return 
decisions did not concern any nationality in 
particular, but was spread among all nation-
alities, suggesting an increased use of return 
when detecting migrants illegally.
Effective returns
In 2014, there was a steady trend of 161 309 
third-country nationals effectively returned 
to countries outside the EU (see Fig. 16). The 
UK was the Member State conducting the 
largest number of returns, with steady trends 
of returned nationals from India and Pakistan. 
Greece reported an increase in effective re-
turns, mostly of Albanians.
Type of return
It is difficult to evaluate the overall cost-ef-
fectiveness of return measures in compari-
son with other practical measures taken to 
reduce irregular migration. Forced returns 
are recognised as being more costly than 
voluntary returns, although Member States 
highlight the importance of return flights 
(including those co-ordinated by Frontex) 
in ensuring an effective return, as well as 
having a deterrent effect for future irregu-
lar migrants.
Within the number of effective returns to 
third countries in 2014, 40% were reported 
to be on voluntary basis and 43% were forced 
returns, while for 17%, the type of return was 
not specified (see Fig. 16).
legal stay between 2009 and 2014). Afghans 
have also ranked high among the top nation-
alities since 2009.
3.8. Returns
In 2014, there were 252 003 third-country na-
tionals subject to an obligation to leave the 
EU as a result of an administrative or judi-
cial decision, which was a 12% increase com-

In terms of nationalities, there is a striking 
difference between the nationality detected 
crossing the border illegally or staying illegally 
in the EU, and the nationality effectively re-
turned (see Fig. 17). Indeed, most people de-
tected crossing the border illegally apply for 
asylum and thus are not returned.
3.9. Facilitators
The facilitation of illegal immigration re-
mains a significant threat to the EU. Detec-
tions of facilitators rose from 7 252 in 2013 
to 10 234 in 2014. The increase was mostly 
due to increases reported in Spain, Italy 
and Bulgaria.
The facilitation of irregular migrants by sea 
is carried out using increasingly diverse modi 
operandi, which often put the lives of migrants 
at risk. The Central and Eastern Mediterra-
nean routes are particularly affected by grow-
ing and sustained flows of irregular migrants 
facilitated to the EU using various types of 
vessels. The recent incidents of large cargo 
vessels containing several hundreds of mi-
grants is evidence of this evolution.
Organised Crime Groups (OCGs) provide fa-
cilitation services to an ever-increasing num-
ber of irregular migrants seeking to reach the 
EU. These OCG activities sustain and exac-
erbate the large-scale influx of irregular mi-
grants to the EU. Driven by a profit-incentive, 
these OCGs callously disregard the safety and 
human rights of migrants. Large and increas-
ing numbers of facilitated irregular migrants 
enter the EU along Europe’s Mediterranean 
coast and engage in secondary movements 
to countries of final destination.
Irregular migrants are also facilitated to en-
ter the EU by air relying on fraudulent docu-
ments. Other modi operandi include marriages 
of convenience as well as the abuse of visas/
overstaying. However, it is difficult to quan-
tify the scope of these activities.
OCGs provide various facilitation services for 
irregular migrants enabling the entry into the 
EU, secondary movements within the EU and 
the transition to legal stay in Member States. 
Most OCGs operate on an international level 
relying on contacts in countries of origin and 
within diaspora communities in transit and 
destination countries. The proportion of fa-
cilitated irregular migrants remains difficult 
to assess.
Facilitation services related to the illegal im-
migration to the EU and secondary move-
ments between Member States are in high 
demand and generate significant profits for 
the OCGs involved. People smuggling is a 
growing market prompting existing OCGs 
and criminals to adapt their business mod-
els and shift from other criminal activities to 
the facilitation of illegal immigration.
3.10. Cross-border crimes
Frontex promotes and coordinates European 
border management with a special focus on 
migration flows. In application of the concept 
of Integrated Border Management, it addi-
tionally supports Member States in combat-
ing organised crime at the external borders, 
including the smuggling of goods and traffick-
ing in human beings. However, due to the le-
gal and institutional national characteristics, 
border-control authorities along the exter-
nal borders of the EU have different types and 
degrees of responsibilities in the fight against 
transnational crimes. The nature and extent 
of inter-agency cooperation at the external 
borders thus differs greatly between Member 
States. Regarding the prevention of smuggling 
of illicit goods, border-control authorities of 
certain Member States play only an assisting 
role, while border-control authorities in other 
Member States share their tasks with customs 
or are able to conduct investigations. Because 
of these differences, cross-border crime data 
reported by some national border guard insti-
Frontex · annual risk analysis 2015
34 of 68
tutions are partial and frequently do not in-
clude data collected by customs.
On the other hand, identifying cross-border 
movements of persons involved in criminal 
activities or victims thereof is a crucial task 
of border-control authorities. Either in the 
case of human trafficking or the travel of vol-
untary fighters with a  jihadist background, 
border agencies are confronted with new 
challenges particularly in the field of interna-
tional and inter-agency cooperation, profil-
ing, identification, and assistance to victims.
3.10.1. Smuggling of illicit drugs
Cannabis from the Western Balkans and 
North Africa
The EU is the destination of several main 
routes for various narcotic drugs, coming from 
different regions of the world including Latin 
America, the Western Balkans, West Asia 
and North Africa. The EU also plays a role of 
a transit point for drugs destined for other 
regions. According to the EMCDDA European 
Drug Report 2014*, 80% of drug seizures in 
Europe were for cannabis in 2012, although 
indicators point to a trend of decreasing use.
Cannabis is smuggled into Europe in the 
form of two distinct products, cannabis resin 
(‘hashish’) and herbal cannabis (‘marijuana’). 
The main provider of cannabis resin to Eu-
rope is Morocco, although its production ca-
pacities are in decline. Spain as an entry door 
for cannabis resin from Morocco reported 
around two thirds of the total quantity of 
resin seized in Europe in 2012.
Within the last years, the number of seizures 
of herbal cannabis have been increasingly 
exceeding resin seizures. The shift towards 
herbal cannabis was predominantly caused 
by an increase of domestic production in 
many European countries. This means that 
trafficking of cannabis products across the 
* EMCDDA (2014), 
European Drug Report: 
Trends and Developments, 
p. 17ff.
EU external borders has decreased, with the 
domestic production increasingly satisfying 
national demand. An exception seems to be 
trafficking activities in southeast Europe, 
where mainly Albanian cannabis supplies 
the customer demand in countries such as 
Greece, Italy, Slovenia, and Hungary.
Cocaine from South America
According to EMCDDA calculations based on 
seizure data, cocaine shows to be the third 
most intensively smuggled drug in Europe af-
ter cannabis resin and herb. In 2012, around 
77 000 seizures of cocaine amounting to 
71 tonnes have been reported by Member 
States.* The number of seizures increased 
between the mid-1990s and 2007, but have 
been declining since 2009. Reported quanti-
ties in contrast have been slightly increasing 
in 2011 and 2012, mostly because of seizures 
made in transit countries including Spain and 
Belgium. Some of the cocaine seized in the 
EU was in fact destined for emerging mar-
kets in third countries such as the Russian 
Federation.
The drug is almost entirely produced in Bo-
livia, Colombia and Peru, with the latter 
having substantially increased its supply to 
Europe.** Cocaine is smuggled from South 
America to the EU across the Atlantic by 
sea and air. Large shipments travelled by sea 
and air from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colom-
bia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela to 
Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, and increas-
ingly also Belgium. Cocaine is smuggled by air 
freight, on pleasure boats and through con-
tainer shipments, but to a large extent also 
by individual airline travellers.
In October 2014, the European Commission 
adopted two reports concluding that Colom-
bia and Peru meet the criteria to start ne-
gotiating agreements allowing their citizens 
visa-free access to the Schengen area. An in-
troduction of short-stay visa waiver agree-

Drug Report, p. 37
35 of 68
ments for citizens of Colombia and Peru, 
however, might allow OCGs to intensify their 
use of individual cocaine couriers.
Although a majority of shipments of cocaine 
continue to enter the EU through Western 
Europe, a diversification of trafficking routes 
away from the very dominant routes to the 
Iberian Peninsula drew a larger share of co-
caine to the ports of the Balkans and the 
Black Sea. Between 2009 and 2011, four 
tonnes of cocaine have been seized in Bul-
garia, Greece, Romania and Turkey, account-
ing for 2% of the overall number of seizures 
reported in Europe.* Bulgarian and Roma-
nian authorities have moreover reported an 
increased role of Nigerian OCGs in the traf-
ficking of cocaine to these countries.**
Heroin from Afghanistan, Iran and 
Pakistan
Seizure numbers and statistics on treatment 
of drug addicts suggest that heroin use in Eu-
rope has been decreasing over the last dec-
ade. Five tonnes of heroin were seized in 2012, 
which represents only 50% of the amount re-
ported by Member States in 2002.*** Most 
of the heroin consumed in the EU is produced 
in Afghanistan and, to a lesser extent, in Iran 
and Pakistan. It is transported along a vari-
ety of routes to Europe, including the Balkan 
route, which runs through Turkey and the 
Balkan countries, the Northern route, which 
heads through Central Asia and the Russian 
Federation, and increasingly the Southern 
route via the Persian Gulf by sea, sometimes 
including passages through Africa.
In 2014, European border guards deployed 
along the Balkan route reported seizures to-
talling 86.4 kg of heroin – more than three 
times as much as in 2013. The largest quan-
tities were seized at the BCP Kapitan An-
dreevo at the Bulgarian-Turkish border and 
at departure from the Greek ferry port of 
Igoumenitsa.

New psychoactive substances
New psychoactive substances comprise 
a wide range of drugs that are in many cases 
not yet under control of national or inter-
national drug legislation. In 2013, the Early 
Warning System of the EMCDDA and Europol 
listed a total of 81 new synthetic substances. 
Although new psychoactive substances rep-
resent only a small share of the illicit drugs 
market, they are particularly dangerous be-
cause limited information about their ef-
fects on the human body is available. These 
substances often come in the form of more 
openly sold ‘Legal Highs’, thereby giving the 
false impression of legality and lower con-
sumer exposure to physical and mental health 
risks. Most new psychoactive substances or 
their precursors arrive in shipments from 
China or India.
The challenges for law-enforcement author-
ities at the external borders of the EU lie 
within the development of capacities to iden-
tify the rapidly developing diversity of new 
psychoactive substances. Drug control leg-
islative measures within the EU also need a 
more coherent approach to prevent the ex-
ploitation of differences and gaps between 
national jurisdictions. The sale of new psycho-
active substances through the internet and 
anonymised networks and the fact that man-
ufacturers, retailers and other parts of the 
market chain are located in different coun-
tries pose additional challenges. In 2013, the 
EMCDDA has identified 651 websites ship-
ping ‘legal highs’ to European consumers.****
3.10.2. Trafficking in human beings (THB)
The detection of persons trafficked for sex-
ual exploitation, forced labour or other pur-
poses represents a major challenge for border 
authorities, as victims themselves are often 
not aware of their fate when they arrive in 
the transit or destination countries.
**** EMCDDA (2014)

36 of 68
In 2014, Eurostat presented its second sta-
tistical working paper on THB at EU level, in-
cluding data on the years 2010–2012. It allows 
a more long-term comparison with data pre-
sented in the first edition of the report, which 
starts with numbers of 2008. Within five 
years, the number of identified victims, male 
and female, registered by police, NGOs and 
other agencies in the Member States in-
creased from 3 691 in 2008 to 4 443 in 2012.* 
As Eurostat points out, more reported cases 
are not necessarily related to a higher num-
ber of actual victims. The upward tendency 
may also be caused by an improved report-
ing rate of the phenomenon.
Data disaggregated by types of exploitation in 
2012 show that a majority of 66% of the vic-
tims were trafficked for the purpose of sexual 
exploitation and 20% for labour exploitation. 
14% were trafficked for forced begging, crim-
inal activities, removal of organs and other 
purposes. Compared to previous years, the 
figures point to a clear trend towards a grow-
ing share of victims identified for sexual ex-
ploitation (2008: 58%), and fewer for labour 
exploitation (14%).
Important for border guards at the external 
borders is the fact that only a minority of 
35% of registered victims came from non-EU 
countries in the years 2010–2012 (EU victims 
mainly come from Romania and Bulgaria). Ac-
cording to Eurostat, the main third countries 
of origin in 2012 were Nigeria, Vietnam as an 
emerging origin country, China, Albania, Bra-
zil, Ukraine, Philippines, Sierra Leone, Domin-
ican Republic and Cameroon. Notably, the 
number of victims from Asia has increased, 
with victims from the Philippines being reg-
istered in bigger numbers for the first time, 
and Vietnamese victims peaking, mainly for 
the purpose of labour exploitation. The re-
emergence of victims of THB from Albania 
in 2012 may be connected to the visa liber-
alisation for Albania by the end of 2010. On 
the other hand, victims from Nigeria were

consistently strongly represented between 
2008 and 2012.
3.10.4. Smuggling of weapons
The effective control of firearms is crucial in 
the fight against crime and it is clear that Eu-
ropean law-enforcement authorities inland 
and at the external borders need to cooperate 
across the EU in the fight against trafficking 
of firearms. The threat emanating from the 
crime is measured not simply by the smug-
gling of the weapons but of the further crimes 
and damage they enable. The terrorist at-
tacks of 7–9 January in France and successive 
police operations showed the availability of 
military-grade arms including AK-47s rocket-
propelled grenade launchers on European 
illicit markets. Many of these weapons are 
illegally traded from former conflict regions 
such as the Western Balkans, where in Bos-
nia and Herzegovina alone around 800 000 
weapons are estimated to be in illegal civil-
ian possession.**
Taking into account increasing passenger flow 
and heavier workload of border guards at the 
EU external borders, and constantly evolving 
and refining modi operandi of weapon smug-
glers, the risk of seeing this criminal activity 
at the EU external borders is increasing. EU 
funding and action have been put in place to 
complement the work of Member States in 
addressing this phenomenon and to improve 
their capabilities in preventing these criminal 
ambitions and averting illicit weapons enter-
ing the EU.***
Smuggled arms might be employed to facil-
itate organised crime groups involved in the 
trafficking of human beings, facilitation of 
illegal immigration, illegal drugs trade and 
more. Arms trafficking might also be linked 
to such crimes as corruption, falsification of 
documents, money laundering and thefts from 
not sufficiently secured weapon storages or 
ammunition stockpiles outside the EU. Ter-

rorist groups might also seek weapons from 
criminal groups to be used in attacks staged 
in the EU. Presumably, criminal groups ex-
plore already existing smuggling routes used 
for other criminal phenomena for smuggling 
small arms and light weapons.
In case of firearms seizures it is important to 
distinguish if the weapon was only trafficked 
for criminals’ protection – e.g. smuggling 
drugs, stolen vehicles – or if it was intended 
to be smuggled to the EU. The differences in 
legislation among Member States and be-
tween third countries and Member States 
create legal loopholes that might be exploited 
for the secondary distribution of weapons 
within the EU. Lack of firearms deactivation 
standards and ease of converting gas, alarm, 
signal and pneumatic guns imported legally 
to the EU into lethal weapons adds additional 
risk. Legal channels of distribution of weap-
ons might also be abused (arms trade, legal 
weapon transits and purchases).
3.10.5. Exit of stolen motor vehicles
According to Eurostat, the total number of 
vehicles including cars, motorcycles, buses, 
lorries, construction and agricultural vehi-
cles stolen in the EU has been steadily fall-
ing between 1998 and 2010. In 2013, statistical 
data published by UNODC counted more 
than 750 000 vehicles stolen in 29 of the EU 
and Schengen Associated Countries, com-
pared to 1.4 million in 2005.* Among the rea-
sons for the decline were the advanced 
technical protection technologies developed 
by the producers and intensified international 
law-enforcement cooperation.
Only a small share of the vehicles stolen in 
the EU are detected at its external borders, 
often in the context of Frontex Joint Opera-
tions. In contrast to the overall theft statis-
tics, detections at the borders reported to 
Frontex showed a decrease from 519 in 2013 
to 487 in 2014. These cases included cars, lor-
* Crime and criminal  
justice statistics,  
http://www.unodc.org/
unodc/en/data-and-analysis/
statistics/crime.html
ries, trailers, boats, excavators, agricultural 
machines and motor bikes.
Most car thefts were detected by querying 
SIS II, the Interpol and national theft data 
with the Vehicle Identification Numbers (VIN) 
specified on the engine, frame and major 
parts of most motor vehicles. Car thieves ap-
plied various modi operandi to cloud the iden-
tity of their stolen vehicles at the external 
borders. Reports indicated frequent manip-
ulation of the VIN, or departure from the EU 
with rental or very recently stolen cars before 
authorities are notified of the theft. In other 
cases, vehicles were disassembled into parts 
to obscure identification or vehicle registra-
tion papers were counterfeited.
The brand preferences did not change dur-
ing the last years, as more than 40% of the 
private vehicles detected were produced by 
Mercedes Benz, Volkswagen and BMW. A 
majority of the persons driving the stolen 
vehicles on exit from the EU were nationals 
of the country which they intended to enter. 
For example, 70% of the persons caught with 
a stolen vehicle at the borders with Ukraine

3.10.6. Smuggling of excise goods
Most excise goods smuggled across the 
EU external borders are tobacco products. 
According to estimates of the European 
Commission, the illicit trade in tobacco prod-
ucts costs the EU and its Member States 
EUR 10 billion a year in lost tax revenues. Not 
only individual consumers and small scale 
smugglers from economically weak border 
regions try to make use of existing price dif-
ferences. Large scale criminal businesses il-
licitly import cigarettes especially to Western 
European markets from as far away as Asia.
In 2014, many governments increased the 
taxes on excise goods to improve their budget 
situation. Between January 2013 and July 2014, 
22 Member States increased their excise du-
ties on cigarettes, in average by EUR 0.10 per 
pack of cigarettes.*

Currently, a customer would pay EUR 5 for an 
average pack of cigarettes in Finland, whereas 
across the Russian border, the same good 
would cost him only around EUR 1. A new 
law would see a 40% increase in the mini-
mum price for cigarettes by 1 April 2015, but 
that price hike was already compensated by 
the recent loss in value of the Russian rou-
ble against the euro. The negative economic 
growth in the Russian Federation is expected 
to increase the illicit trade of tobacco prod-
ucts to the EU, by both individual ‘ant-smug-
glers’ from the border regions and OCGs.
On 9 January 2014, the Protocol to Eliminate 
Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products, was closed 
for signature by the Parties to the WHO 
Framework Convention on Tobacco Con-
trol. At this time, it was signed by 53 States, 
including 15 Member States, and by the EU. 
The Protocol will enter into force 90 days af-
ter the 40th ratification. To assist in the inves-
tigation of illicit cross-border trade in tobacco 
products, it requires States to implement a 
global tracking and tracing regime through 
unique, secure and non-removable identifi-
cation markings, such as codes or stamps on

40 of 68
cigarette packages. Within the EU, this and 
other measures for public health are imple-
mented through the revised Tobacco Prod-
ucts Directive, which entered into force on 
19 May 2014 and will apply after a transpo-
sition period of two years.
A tracking system that assists law-enforce-
ment authorities in determining if cigarettes 
were traded illegally was already agreed upon 
between the EU and the four largest to-
bacco manufacturers, which cover 80% of the 
world market. Through these agreements the 
companies committed themselves to sell to 
legitimate clients only. However, smaller com-
panies outside the EU currently still sell large 
quantities to third-country markets where 
only an insignificant share of these cigarettes 
can be absorbed by the local demand. Much 
of the rest is then smuggled out to Member 
States. In particular seizures of ‘cheap white 
brands’ have been showing a strong upward 
tendency over the past years. An example is 
the Jin Ling cigarette brand produced in Kalin-
ingrad, which grew so popular among west-
ern consumers that this brand itself started 
to be counterfeited.
3.11. Asylum applications
Data on asylum applications are not related 
to law-enforcement activities, but provides 
contextual information on movements of per-
sons towards the EU. The analysis of asylum 
applications for international protection pro-
vides useful information on the push and pull 
factors at play in mixed migration flows. It is 
also important for border-control authorities 
because they are often the first authorities 
prospective applicants meet, before being re-
ferred to asylum authorities. Border-control 
authorities also play a role in the implemen-
tation of the Dublin system. As mentioned in 
recital 3 of the Eurodac Regulation (and in re-
cital 4 of the recast Eurodac Regulation), for 
the purposes of applying the Dublin Regula-
tion, it is necessary to establish the identity 
of applicants for asylum and of persons ap-
prehended in connection with the unlawful 
crossing of the external borders.
Finally, unfounded applications for interna-
tional protection inevitably delay the exami-
nation and subsequent provision of protection 
for those third-country nationals with genu-
ine claims. When applications are made af-
ter an unsuccessful attempt to illegally enter 
the territory (illegal border-crossing, docu-
ment fraud, refusal of entry, clandestine en-
try), it overloads border-control authorities 
and dilutes allocated resources.
In 2014, Frontex has developed its collabora-
tion with EASO, which notably contributed 
to the analysis of the data on asylum appli-
cations, based on the data they collected 
through their newly established network.
Approximately 615 000 applicants for asylum 
(+41% compared to 2013) were registered in 
2014, which marked the highest level received 
in the EU since EU-level data collection be-
gan in 2008. 90% of applicants people ap-
plying for the first time in the EU.
The main nationalities of applicants were 
Syrians (over 120 000) and those of West-
ern Balkan countries (>107 000 considered 
together). After a sudden rise in the number 
of applications at the beginning of spring, 
Eritrea became the second most common 
country of origin of asylum claimants in the 
EU and Schengen Associated Countries, with 
over 40 000 applicants in 2014. Significant 
(over 50%) increases were also seen in ap-
plications from citizens of Pakistan and Af-
ghanistan. The situation in Ukraine caused a 
particularly significant change in relation to 
previous years. A total of over 14 000 claims 
were received in 2014 in the EU – a 14-fold 
increase compared to 2013 – but the applica-
tions were not limited to countries bordering 
Ukraine, but spread across all Member States. 
In parallel, many Ukrainians sought alterna-
41 of 68
tives to asylum via family reunification or vi-
sas and residence permits for work.
Compared to last year, 21 Member States re-
ported more applications for international 
protection than in 2013. Among these, three 
Member States, all of which are located at the 
EU external borders, saw particularly sharp 
rises: Italy (+146%), Hungary (+125%) and Bul-
garia (+54%).
EASO’s new Early warning and Preparedness 
System (EPS) data collection, which started in 
March 2014, includes the numbers of implicit 
withdrawals of asylum applications: this cov-
ers cases where a person applies in a Mem-
ber State and then absconds and is no longer 
contactable by the Member State. Many of 
such persons later apply again for interna-
tional protection in another Member State 
and may eventually be returned in accord-
ance with the stipulations of the Dublin III 
Regulation. From the initial data it appears 
that the proportion of asylum applications 
that are implicitly withdrawn is particularly 
high (above 30% of all applications) in several 
States at the EU external land border (Poland, 
Latvia, Croatia, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia 
and Lithuania). Notwithstanding a more de-
tailed analysis of the links between border-
crossing indicators, asylum applications and 
withdrawn applications, this pattern might 
indicate potential misuses of the asylum pro-
cedure whereby an individual may make an 
application for international protection in or-
der to circumvent obligations applicable to 
regular border-control.
This can also be an issue with those arriving 
in an irregular manner by sea. Large numbers 
of potential applicants for asylum can lead to 
severe difficulties in registration. In summer 
of 2014 legal and administrative questions 
led to the non-fingerprinting of some asy-
lum-applicants in Eurodac in Italy leading to 
the non-application of Dublin for those who 
absconded from reception centres in Sicily 
and other areas and then travelled north to 
lodge asylum claims in other Member States. 
Italy resolved this issue by issuing instruc-
tions to Questure to take fingerprints of all 
arrivals even forcibly, if necessary, after the 
correct legal interpretation issue was clari-
fied by the Commission and Member States 
in the autumn.

4.2.  Renewed Internal Security 
Strategy
The EU Strategic Guidelines for the Justice and 
Home Affairs Area were adopted in June 2014 
and included a call for the renewal of the EU 
Internal Security Strategy (ISS) by mid-2015 
as part of the efforts to promote operational 
police cooperation and to prevent and com-
bat serious organised crime, including human 
trafficking and smuggling, as well as corrup-
tion. Furthermore, the Council Conclusions of 
December 2014 on a renewed Internal Secu-
rity Strategy call for an update of the EU IBM 
Concept. The European Commission will, on 
the basis of opinions given by the European 
Parliament and the Council of the EU, pre-
sent a Communication on the renewed ISS 
by spring 2015. The five strategic objectives 
which were agreed upon for the initial ISS will 
remain as priorities. These objectives are: the 
disruption of international criminal networks; 
the prevention of terrorism and addressing 
radicalisation and recruitment; raising lev-
els of security for citizens and businesses in 
cyberspace; strengthening security through 
border management; and increasing Europe’s 
resilience to crises and disasters.

In February 2011, the Commission presented 
a proposal for an EU Passenger Name Re-

guards for the processing and collection of 
PNR data from flights to and from the EU. 
The Commission has declared its commit-

4.1.  European Commission’s 
priorities in 2015
The 2015 European Commission programme 
of work was adopted in December 2014 and 
set out the main actions the Commission in-
tends to take throughout the coming year. 
Included here was the European Agenda on 
Migration, the objective of which is to de-
velop a new approach to legal migration to 
make the EU an attractive destination for 
talents and skills, as well as to improve the 
management of migration by intensifying 
cooperation with third countries, fostering 
burden sharing and solidarity and fighting 
against irregular migration and smuggling. 
The agenda includes the review of the Blue 
Card Directive, the EU-wide work permit for 
highly skilled workers.
The Commission Communication on the 
Work Programme states: 
‘To tackle the growing pressure at our 
external borders the Commission is de-
veloping a European Agenda on Migra-
tion, which will balance a fairer and 
responsible approach to legal migra-
tion, in order to make the EU an attrac-
tive destination for talent and skills, with 
firm measures against irregular migra-
tion and people trafficking and smug-
gling. Improving the management of 
migration means better linking our mi-
gration policy with our external policy, 
fostering greater internal and external 
cooperation, offering protection to per-
sons in need, based on responsibility and 
solidarity and preventing tragic events 
such as those recurrently happening in 
the Mediterranean.’

4.4.  New Schengen Evaluation 
Mechanism
Preparations are ongoing as regards the im-
plementation of the new Schengen evalu-
ation mechanism. In line with Regulation 
1053/2013 establishing an evaluation and 
monitoring mechanism to verify the appli-
cation of the Schengen acquis, the standard 
evaluation questionnaire was adopted in July 
2014. In October, the annual evaluation pro-
gramme for 2015 was approved on the basis 
of the multi-annual evaluation programme 
2014–2019, taking into account the risk anal-
ysis provided by Frontex as well as informa-
tion made available by relevant EU agencies 
and bodies such as Europol and the Funda-
mental Rights Agency. The first evaluations 
under the new mechanism (concerning an-
nounced visits) started in February 2015 in 
Austria. In the meantime, a particular focus 
has been put on further developing training 
for the evaluation experts, including updat-
ing the existing training curricula by including 
aspects that have not been covered previ-
ously, such as return.
4.5.  EUROSUR Handbook
The first edition of the EUROSUR Handbook, 
as required by Article 21 of the EUROSUR Reg-
ulation, was agreed upon by the end of 2014 
in meetings between the Member States, the 
Commission and Frontex. The Handbook will 
provide technical and operational guidelines, 
recommendations and best practices, includ-
ing on cooperation with third countries. The 
European Commission shall adopt the Hand-
book in the form of a recommendation in the 
course of 2015.
4.6.  Roll-out and impact of Visa 
Information System
The Visa Information System (VIS) will be 
rolled out, region by region, until all Schen-
gen states’ consulates worldwide are con-
nected. So far, the VIS has started operations 
in North Africa in October 2011; in the Near 
East in May 2012; in the Gulf region in Octo-
ber 2012; in West and Central Africa in March 
2013; in East and Southern Africa in June 2013; 
in South America in September 2013; and in 
Central and South East Asia and in the occu-
pied Palestinian Territory in November 2013. 
The year 2014 saw the introduction of the VIS 
in Turkey and the Western Balkans.
A new timetable was agreed upon for the fi-
nal VIS roll outs during 2015. The latest time 
frame for the roll-out in regions 17–23 is as 
follows:
n  June 2015 for region 17 (Armenia, Azerbai-
jan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine);
n  September 2015 for region 18 (the Russian 
Federation);
n  October 2015 for region 19 (China, Ja-

kistan, Sri-Lanka), 21 (Andorra, Holy See, 
Monaco, San Marino), 22 (Ireland and the 
UK) and 23 (Schengen Member States).

4.7.  Schengen visa policy 
developments
On 17 March 2014, the European Parliament 
endorsed the Agreement between the EU 
and the Republic of Azerbaijan on the fa-
cilitation of the issuance of visas.
Progress reports on Kosovo*, Turkey and 
Georgia were published. Whilst the second 
progress report regarding Kosovo* notes good 
progress, the Commission considered that 
further efforts are required to obtain visa-
free travel for Kosovo* citizens. Turkey’s first 
progress report on fulfilment of the visa lib-
eralisation roadmap was presented by the 
Commission on 20 October 2014. The Com-
mission’s second progress report on Geor-
gia’s implementation of Visa Liberalisation 
Action Plan (VLAP) has concluded that the 
first-phase requirements of the visa dialogue 
have been met and the second phase where 
implementation of benchmarks will be re-
viewed can therefore be launched.
In 2014, an amendment to Regulation 
539/2001 was adopted which included ad-
ditional 17 countries (16 Pacific and Carib-
bean island nations** and the United Arab 
Emirates) to the list of third countries whose 
nationals are exempt from the EU visa re-
quirement. However, before this exemption 
can come into force the Commission must 
negotiate visa waiver agreements with each 
of these 17 countries. The processes for the 
various countries are currently ongoing and 
once negotiations are completed, they will be 
submitted for approval to the European Par-
liament and Council. Following this, and once 
the ratification procedures are completed in 
both the EU and the concerned third coun-
try, the visa waiver agreement will enter into 
force for the citizens of those countries, thus 
enabling visa-free travel. Negotiations for the 
various countries are at differing stages, but 
it is hoped that the visa-free travel for these

countries will become a reality at various 
points in 2015. It is unlikely that visa-free sta-
tus for these 17 countries will bring any addi-
tional risks in terms of migration and security.
In the aforementioned amendment of Regu-
lation 539/2001, Peru and Colombia were also 
included in the visa-free list. Following this, 
on 29 October 2014 the Commission adopted 
two reports concluding that Colombia and 
Peru met the criteria to start negotiating 
agreements allowing their citizens visa–free 
access to the Schengen area. They are now 
preparing a recommendation for a mandate 
from Council to open negotiations on the 
visa waiver. Once granted, the Commission 
will begin negotiations with both countries. 
Only after the short-stay visa waiver agree-
ments enter into force will visa-free travel 
for the citizens of these countries become a 
reality. This could happen, at the very earli-
est, in the second half of 2015.
The EU-Ukraine Association Agreement was 
signed in late 2014. Among other rules, the 
deal provides for greater movement of work-
ers and sets targets for establishing a visa-
free travel regime and aligning the two sides’ 
regulatory systems by laying down detailed 
timetables for Ukraine to transpose parts of 
the EU acquis legislation into its national laws 
and put them into effect.
As a result of the Statement of the Heads of 
State or Government on Ukraine of 6 March 
2014 following the violation of Ukrainian 
sovereignty and territorial integrity by the 
Russian Federation, the visa liberalisation 
dialogue with the country was suspended.

4.8.  State of play concerning 
the ‘Smart Borders 
Package’ (entry/exit 
system and the registered 
traveller programme)
The proposal for a Smart Borders Package 
was first examined by the European Par-
liament and Council in February 2014 and 
there they voiced technical, operational and 
cost concerns, mainly related to the overall 
feasibility of the proposed new systems. To 
counter these, the Commission subsequently 
initiated the proof of concept exercise which 
consisted of two stages.
The first stage, consisting of a Commission-
led Technical Study aimed at identifying and 
assessing the most suitable and promising 
options and solutions, was completed by 
late 2014. The results of which then fed into 
the second stage of the proof of concept: an 
eu-LISA run pilot project. This pilot project 
which will last for most of 2015 is aimed at 
verifying the feasibility of the options identi-
fied in the Technical Study and validating the 
selected concepts for both automated and 
manual border controls. This Pilot will be un-
dertaken at various border crossing points of 
volunteering Member States/Schengen As-
sociated Countries.
Once the results of this pilot project are pub-
lished by the end of 2015, legislative delibera-
tions will restart in the European Parliament 
and the Council. However, it is not expected 
that any eventual system would be in place 
at the borders before 2020.
4.9.  Recast Eurodac Regulation
The amendment of the Eurodac Regulation 
to allow law-enforcement authorities to con-
sult the Eurodac database for the purpose of 
prevention, detection or investigation of ter-
rorist offences and of other serious criminal 
offences was adopted in 2013. The new rules 
will only become applicable though from 20 
July 2015. The comparison of fingerprints in 
the possession of Member States’ designated 
law-enforcement authorities and Europol 
against those stored in the Eurodac database 
will only be possible where such a compari-
son is necessary in specific cases, under well-
defined circumstances and conditions, and 
following prior checks of other databases.
4.10.  Asylum Procedures 
Directive changes
The recast asylum acquis package brought 
about significant changes to the previous 
framework. Its updated requirements cre-
ated a new environment for asylum systems 
of participating Member States and will con-
tinue to transform them as remaining trans-
position deadlines approach in July 2015.
Of particular relevance are the revisions to 
the Dublin system, new rules regarding access 
to procedure, as well as a revised framework 
concerning border and accelerated proce-
dures, including the situation of vulnerable 
applicants and applicants in need of special 
procedural guarantees.*
The revised Dublin Regulation** is already 
applicable and it introduces additional guar-
antees to persons in a Dublin procedure (ob-
ligatory personal interview and information 
on the procedure for establishing the Mem-
ber State responsible, extended options for 
reunifying family and relatives, and additional 
guarantees for minors, including best inter-
est of a child determination and family track-
ing). The transfer to the Member States 
responsible under Dublin can now be ap-
pealed and a motion for suspensive effect of 
the appeal may be submitted (granting the 
right to remain within the territory while the 
court is determining the motion for suspen-
sion). Legal assistance free of charge is to be 
provided upon request and the overall dura-
tion of detention is strictly limited. More pre-

cise deadlines are introduced for procedures 
between States. The Dublin Regulation, in its 
revised form, also covers applicants who could 
otherwise fall under the Return Directive as 
irregular migrants and be returned as such.
The revised Eurodac Regulation* improves 
data protection standards and sets new time 
limits for transmitting fingerprint data to the 
central unit of Eurodac. National police ser-
vices and Europol can access Eurodac data for 
the purposes of comparing Eurodac data with 
fingerprints linked to criminal investigations 
(though only if specific requirements are met, 
and only as concerns the most serious crimes 
as a last resort after checking other available 
databases. There is no possibility to share in-
formation with third countries).
Article 6 of the recast Asylum Procedures Di-
rective (APD) clarifies the responsibilities of 
state authorities in regard to ensuring access 
to the asylum procedure for those wishing to 
make an application, in particular the neces-
sity for states to register all expressions of 
intent to apply made to whichever national 
authority is the first point of contact for the 
potential applicant. Article 8 stipulates that 
training must to be provided to officials who 
may come into contact with persons seeking 
international protection (in particular dur-
ing the surveillance of land or maritime bor-
ders or during border checks) so that they 
are able, inter alia, to provide information on 
where and how an application can be lodged.
The recast APD also states clearly that per-
sons present in the territorial waters of a 
Member State who made an application for 
international protection should be disem-
barked on land and have their applications 
examined. Moreover, the conditions and safe-
guards for applying border and accelerated 
procedures have now been clarified and, in 
particular, the grounds under which such 
procedures can be applied have been made 
exhaustive.
New rules regarding identification and treat-
ment of vulnerable groups have been put in 
place in the recast Reception Conditions Di-
rective (obligation to conduct an individual 
assessment to identify the particular recep-
tion needs for vulnerable persons and ensure 
access to psychological support, legal assis-
tance and information, as well as restrictions 
on detaining vulnerable persons, including 
minors). Applicants in need of special proce-
dural guarantees, e.g. due to their age, disa-
bility, illness, sexual orientation or traumatic 
experiences, should be identified in due time 
and provided with adequate support such as 
sufficient time to make their claims in line 
with provisions of the recast APD. In practi-
cal terms, those new requirements combined 
may substantially limit the use of border and 
accelerated procedures with regard to cer-
tain groups of applicants.
The recast Reception Conditions Directive 
also sets forth rules concerning qualifications 
required of the representatives of unaccom-
panied minors. This may be particularly rel-
evant for Member States experiencing high 
numbers of unaccompanied minors who ab-
scond after lodging an application, which 
may be linked to child trafficking and child 
smuggling.

Based on the descriptions of the situation in 
2014 and a review of the main factors, be it 
economic, legal or technical, that can contrib-
ute one way or another to irregular migration 
to the EU, this chapter reviews the possible 
evolution of the situation along the external 
border of the EU in the coming years. While 
some developments are likely to material-
ise, others seem possible, based on current 
knowledge. Finally, past experiences demon-
strate that there are a large number of un-
foreseeable events and factors that can have 
a profound and unpredictable impact on the 
situation at the border.
5.1.  Illegal border-crossing 
expected to remain 
concentrated in southern 
and south-eastern borders 
of the EU
The best forecasts – those likely to material-
ise and have a direct bearing on the situation 
at the external borders – are the continued 
use of the Mediterranean area as the main 
crossing points for irregular migration. At 
the same time, border-control authorities 
are expected to be increasingly engaged in 
search and rescue operations covering vast 
areas of the Mediterranean Sea, as well as 
being the first interlocutors for a growing 
number of persons presenting themselves 
at the EU borders in search of international 
protection.
Irregular migratory flows are expected to 
follow known routes from North Africa and 
the Middle East to the EU, mostly by sea and 
through the south-eastern land border via 
Turkey. The main uncertainties concern the 
timing, as well as the size and composition 
of the flows. The composition and/or the size 
of the flow will vary in response to the de-
veloping situation in North Africa and in the 
Middle East, particularly in Syria and neigh-
bouring countries.
Swift diversification of modi operandi, possi-
ble displacement between routes or border 
types, and escalating attempts to evade de-
tection or identification are all likely to occur 
in response to enhanced surveillance.
Based on the location of the main countries 
of origin for irregular migration to the EU for 
the past five years, the border areas that are 
most likely to deal with illegal border-crossing 
remain the Southern Mediterranean coast, 
and the borders with Turkey. Migrants living 
in or having relatively easy/facilitated access 
to Turkey and/or North Africa will continue 
to be overrepresented in the flow of irregu-
lar migrants to the EU. In particular, depar-
tures of sub-Saharan migrants from Libya 
across the Central Mediterranean to reach It-
aly and arrivals of Syrians crossing the border 
illegally to apply for asylum in the EU – two 
phenomena already present in 2013 and 2014 
– are likely to continue in the near future.

In addition, the increasing likelihood of fam-
ily units crossing the border, means that bor-
der-control authorities need to be prepared 
to manage flow of vulnerable people, includ-
ing numerous children. This makes it neces-
sary to focus on the further development 
of specific mechanisms and procedures to 
tackle the needs of this vulnerable group at 
the EU external borders, including all air, land 
and sea borders.
Central Mediterranean area
In the Central Mediterranean, many areas on 
the North African coasts may be used as de-
parture points for illegal border-crossing to 
the EU. North African countries may be used 
as transit countries for migrants from more 
southern African countries to sail across the 
Mediterranean. They may be used as transit 
by migrants from many different countries of 
origin, which complicate further predictions 
in terms of volume. However, with Egypt and 
Algeria now requiring visa for Syrian nationals, 
these countries are no longer practical tran-
sit countries on the way to Libya, the typi-
cal departure point in 2014. Turkey has no 
such visa requirements for Syrian nationals 
and this country may now become the main 
country of departure.
The increasing complexity of irregular arrivals 
are expected to absorb significant resources. 
The broadening of the surveillance area along 
with increasing trend in boats seeking assis-
tance, result in border assets being increas-
ing mobilised in support of search and rescues 
activities. In addition, the profits generated 
by the use of old cargo ships for smuggling 
migrants may increase their use, including in 
the Central Mediterranean.
Eastern Mediterranean area
On the Eastern Mediterranean route, en-
hanced surveillance along the land borders 
with Turkey has resulted in a displacement 
on the Eastern Aegean Sea. This is expected 
to put further pressure on the limited local 
reception facilities for undocumented mi-
grants. The large number of migrants ex-
pected to cross illegally the external borders 
will also undermine systematic screening and 
debriefing activities. Nationality swapping is 
expected to remain an issue.
In addition, an increasing number of migrants 
from North Africa and the Middle East are ex-
pected to transit to Turkey via the air bor-
der, before attempting to cross illegally the 
border to the EU, also by using forged docu-
ment. Istanbul airport (IST) is an important 
hub for irregular migrants travelling by air to 
several Member States, with continuous in-
crease in passenger flows for the past several 
years and Turkish Airlines’ expansion strategy 
towards Africa and the Middle East. Turkish 
airports are thus likely to remain common 
embarkation points for irregular migrants 
arriving in the EU.
As a consequence, the number of migrants 
undertaking secondary movements through 
the Western Balkans is also expected to rise.
5.2.  Increased workload at the 
border
Regular passenger flows across the external 
border will increase significantly in the com-
ing years due to rising global mobility. Visa 
liberalisation processes and local border traf-
fic agreements are placing also increasing re-
sponsibilities on border-control authorities.
Increasingly, while movements across the 
external air borders are managed through a 
layered approach, where the border is divided 
into four components (in departure coun-
tries, at embarking airports, at the border 
and after border-crossing), the physical bor-
der is increasingly becoming a secondary layer 
for risk assessment, meaning that checking 
and screening start well before passengers 
49 of 68
cross border-control posts at airports. Border 
management will increasingly be risk-based, 
to ensure that interventions are focused on 
high-risk movements of people, while low-
risk movements are facilitated smoothly.
Air travel environment is becoming more 
complex with the growth of low-cost carri-
ers. In addition, advances in travel complex-
ity and increasing sophistication of criminal 
activities result in increasing workload for 
border-control officers and increasing diffi-
culties in developing planes and passengers 
risk assessments.
In addition, the EU continues to receive a 
high number of asylum seekers. A substan-
tial number of economic migrants appear 
to use the asylum procedure to try entering 
or staying on the territory of the EU. Their 
first interlocutors are often border-control 
authorities.
5.3.  Increased abuse of 
fraudulent breeder* 
documents
Given the increasing level of security features 
in modern travel documents and stricter mi-
gration policies across Member States, the 
misuse of genuine travel documents (which 
includes impersonation and fraudulently ob-
tained documents) is likely to be an entry 
method which will steadily rise.
Some of these issues will be addressed by the 
Visa Information System (VIS), which is oper-
ational and used by issuing authorities in 11 re-
gions as of November 2013, and will be rolled 
out to additional regions in 2014 and 2015.
The systematic check on arrivals of VIS vi-
sas is likely to result in increased abuse of 
fraudulent breeder documents required to 
obtain genuine VIS, as well as EU passports 
which do not require systematic biometric 
controls at the border. In addition, the use 
* supporting documents, 
such as birth certificates, 
presented to the 
authorities to obtain 
an authentic travel 
document
of specific fraudulent techniques to fool bi-
ometric checks, like spoofed fingerprints, is 
also likely to increase.
5.4. Movement of terrorists
Overall, there is an underlying threat of ter-
rorism-related travel movements especially 
due to the appeal of the Syrian conflict to 
both idealist and radicalised youths. The 
conflict in Syria has attracted thousands of 
foreign fighters, including EU citizens, dual-
nationality holders and other third-coun-
try nationals.
Turkey has become the country most often 
used by foreign fighters to enter or exit Syria 
primarily because of its geographical loca-
tion plus the availability of legal and cheap 
travel options.
It is possible that foreign fighters use irregular 
migration routes and/or facilitation networks 
(irrespective of whether this is recommended 
by terrorist structures or not), especially when 
the associated risks and costs are perceived 
as low in comparison to legal travel options.
Frontex is not in a position to identify, nor 
does it have any information that suggests, 
any nexus between terrorist travel and ir-
regular migration routings and/or facilitation 
networks. Nonetheless, it cannot be excluded 
that EU-based fighters change their modi op-
erandi of travel when faced with administra-
tive and/or legal measures upon their return; 
or that may be reluctant to return home in 
fear of reprisal, which may induce them to 
resettle elsewhere.
5.5. Health risk assessment
The main focus of Frontex is on strengthen-
ing border-control cooperation to facilitate 
bona fide migration management, combat 
cross-border crime and prevent threats to 
the Member States. This includes the pre-
Frontex · annual risk analysis 2015
50 of 68
vention of threats to public health, as defined 
by the International Health Regulations of 
the World Health Organization. For the first 
time, the Annual Risk Analysis 2015 presents 
the WHO Regional Office for Europe’s re-
view of the potential public health risks as-
sociated with the migration phenomena and 
ways to adequately address them, prepared 
under the project ‘Public Health Aspects of 
Migration in Europe’ (PHAME).
As human mobility in Europe rises, health 
security attracts increasing attention as 
a means of safeguarding the health of the 
population. Health security has been tra-
ditionally considered a domestic concern. 
However, the public health challenges of hu-
man mobility and large migration have been 
as well recognised as foreign policy matters, 
claiming for a need of international cooper-
ation to safeguard public health as a global 
common good. The analysis of health risks 
requires an overview of the health hazards 
arising in the countries of origin and tran-
sit, at the border and within the countries 
of destination.
Migrants are exposed to a number of differ-
ent health risks during the migration process. 
However, the impact of the journey varies 
depending on the category of the migrant, 
undocumented migrants being among the 
most vulnerable given the often harsh con-
ditions of the journey and the limited access 
to health services. The following analysis, 
therefore, focuses on undocumented migra-
tion. The public health aspects of migration 
affect both health care and non-health care 
workers involved in the various stages of the 
migration process, as well as resident com-
munities. In the countries of destination, mi-
gration often streches the capacity of health 
care systems to adapt to the additional de-
mand for health services, and the unfamil-
iar and changing health profiles and needs. 
Due to the common lack of proper prepara-
tion and information, the health risks posed 
by migrants are often overestimated by the 
receiving communities.
5.5.1. Migrants
Pre-departure
The risk of acquiring vaccine-preventable dis-
eases depends on the presence of susceptible 
individuals in the population and their epide-
miological profile. In many countries of ori-
gin and transit the health care systems are 
weakened by civil unrest, wars, economic 
crisis and natural disasters. The provision of 
public health services including vaccination 
to the population is often interrupted or even 
withheld, resulting in a dramatic reduction 
of the immunisation coverage. For instance, 
in the Syrian Arab Republic, the immunisa-
tion coverage has fallen from 91% registered 
in 2011 to 68% in 2012. Although efforts have 
been made to improve immunisation cover-
age, there are still deep concerns on the im-
munisation status of Syrians, including those 
asking for asylum in European countries.
In countries with high tuberculosis (TB) inci-
dence and prevalence, large portions of the 
population have a status of latent TB infec-
tion that can be developed to TB disease, of-
ten contagious, in case of decreased immune 
response. Such situation may be created by 
the hard conditions of a journey which may 
start before crossing the border of the coun-
try of destination.
Travel and transit
Health risks at this phase vary depending on 
the conditions and duration of the travel. The 
conditions to which migrants are exposed to 
during the journey as well as in the countries 
of destination put them at risk of sexual vic-
timisation, violence and sexual ill-health. Ref-
ugees, asylum seekers and undocumented 
migrants, especially women, infants and chil-
dren, were identified as the most vulnerable 
51 of 68
ones. Other risks arising throughout the jour-
ney and specially during rescue operations 
include drowning, traumatism, burns, hypo-
thermia, dehydration, heatstroke, foodborne 
diseases, respiratory and skin infections.
Host community
At reception centres, overcrowding and inad-
equate hygiene and sanitary conditions cou-
pled with limited access to health care are 
well known risk factors for acquiring a va-
riety of communicable diseases. The risk of 
measles, diphtheria and whooping cough is 
enhanced in the presence of susceptible in-
dividuals. Furthermore, scarce hygiene and 
sanitary conditions increase the risk of gas-
tro-intestinal and skin infections.
Mental health disorders and chronic diseases 
can be left undiagnosed and untreated, lead-
ing to further deterioration of the health 
condition of the migrants, even after reach-
ing their destination. Even if chronic diseases 
are detected during the first screening proce-
dures, lack of communication between recep-
tion centres where migrants are transferred 
to may cause the suspension of treatments 
with serious consequences. Potentially long 
and unspecified periods of stay, unclear legal 
status, communication difficulties and past-
traumatic experiences expose the migrants 
to mental health risks.
Social, economic and political factors in or-
igin and destination countries influence the 
risk of HIV infection of migrants. Isolation and 
stress may lead migrants to engage in behav-
iours – such as unsafe casual or commercial 
sex and drug use – which increase HIV risk. 
This risk is exacerbated by inadequate access 
to HIV services and fear of being stigmatised 
for seeking HIV-related information or sup-
port. Female migrants may be particularly 
vulnerable to HIV and susceptible to exploi-
tation and/or physical and sexual violence.
Migrants in a vulnerable situation may expe-
rience poor housing and working conditions, 
as well as limited access to health services, 
which may cause TB infection or the reacti-
vation of a previous TB infection into disease. 
Same conditions can be cause of delays in di-
agnosis and premature interruptions of their 
treatment, which eventually could develop 
into a multi-drug resistent form of TB. Proper 
education and complete access to cultural-
sensitive quality and supportive services are 
of paramount importance.
5.5.2. Workforce at the border and in 
the reception centres
Health risks for health and non-health work-
force vary depending on the resistance and 
vulnerability of each individual, the working 
conditions as well as the potential exposure 
to biological agents. Rescuers may be exposed 
to trauma, injuries, hypothermia, drowning 
and heatstroke during rescue operations. Due 
to their difficult working conditions, psycho-
logical support to the workers both at the 
border and in the migration centres is also 
relevant. Adequate screening procedures fo-
cused on communicable, non-communicable 
diseases as well as mental health should be 
performed when required and with full re-
spect to human rights.

In an EU migration environment character-
ised by increasing pressures at the borders 
coupled with often decreasing resources for 
their handling, the challenge for border-con-
trol authorities is to become more effective 
and efficient whilst maintaining the necessary 
quality standards. Risk analysis must then be 
able to provide both short- and longer-term 
recommendations for decision makers. The 
following chapter provides a concise descrip-
tion of a selection of areas where risk mitiga-
tion initiatives could take place. Clearly there 
exist many areas where this could be recom-
mended but the following chapter consists of 
one selection of issues identified and chosen 
on the basis of the Frontex risk analysis car-
ried out throughout this year. The objective 
of this chapter is to ensure high-level aware-
ness of selected areas for potential action and 
can serve as a practical example of how to 
follow on from risk analysis into correspond-
ing risk mitigation decisions.
6.1.  Security aspects of border 
management
Given the threats visible at the external bor-
ders of the EU, it is evident that border man-
agement has an important security 
component. Indeed, according to the Schen-
gen Borders Code, officials at the borders are 
charged with helping to ‘combat illegal im-
migration and trafficking in human beings 
and to prevent any threat to the Member 
States’ internal security’.* However, in view 
of the increasing security threats witnessed 
at the external borders during the past year, 
it is necessary to further clarify the role of, 
and tools available to border management 
authorities in this area.
What useful function can be played by the 
border authorities in the area of counter-ter-
rorism or combatting smuggling of weapons 
for instance? The threat of terrorist activi-
ties and the methods of entry into the EU 
have been much discussed during the past 
year due to several incidents which occurred 
within the EU in 2014 and early 2015. Delin-
eating the tasks and the potential tools of 
those working at the borders in helping to 
combat this threat is an important discussion 
which should be undertaken. Given that 2015 
will also be the year in which the EU renews 
and updates the EU Internal Security Strat-
egy and the European Commission will adopt 
a European Agenda on Security, this discus-
sion would also be very appropriately timed.
Certain cross-border crimes, such as traffick-
ing in human beings, and the role to be played 
by border authorities in tackling them have 
been well addressed. Other areas could also 
benefit from further attention, for instance 
in the fight against smuggling of firearms and 
ammunition into the EU. Taking into account 
the dual circumstances of larger passenger 
flows at the borders and an increasing threat 
of small amounts of firearms and ammunition 
being smuggled by individuals, rather than 
as part of dedicated and larger shipments, it 
is clear that this represents an increasingly 
challenging phenomena for border guards 
to handle. There is a need then to address 
border management’s function in thwart-
ing these criminal ambitions and preventing 
an increasing numbers of illicit firearms, its 
parts and ammunition from entering the EU.
With the above issues in mind, specialised 
and integrated trainings across the EU and 
improved intelligence gathering and analysis 
would certainly help to provide for stronger 
cross-border crime prevention and detection. 
A stronger emphasis could be placed on in-
creasing risk analysis capacities at a national

level. This could then be employed in, for in-
stance, developing risk profiles of potential 
offenders and assessing passenger informa-
tion. Improved knowledge on the security 
threats faced at the borders with information 
on the modalities, actions, and the modi op-
erandi typically employed at the borders by 
offenders could all prove useful additions to 
the border control authorities’ cross-border 
crime tackling toolkit. These measures would 
all fall under the broader umbrella exercise 
of better defining and designing the security 
aspect of border management. 
6.2.  Full identification of 
individuals entering the EU
As previous chapters have discussed, 2014 
saw increased arrivals at the external borders 
of the EU, often in large, mixed and some-
times overwhelming influxes at particular 
borders. The corollary of this was the strain 
placed on border control authorities which 
left them with fewer resources available for 
identifying those attempting to enter the 
EU. This then resulted in some of the figures 
seen in the past year, where high numbers 
of entrants were not attributed a national-
ity. Pressures faced at a border can also lead 
to increases in the phenomenon of nation-
ality swapping for the purposes fraudulent 
entry to the EU. Additionally it is an obliga-
tion stemming from the Schengen Borders 
Code that entrants must have their nation-
alities identified.
The importance of this issue is two-fold; there 
is both a humanitarian and a security ration-
ale. Firstly, granting international protection 
to those in need is a legal obligation. Hence 
why there is a strong need to ensure the cor-
rect and full identification of those arriving 
at the borders so as to provide the full nec-
essary protection, where required. Secondly, 
the identification issue concerns the potential 
threat to internal security. With large num-
bers of arrivals remaining essentially unclas-
sified for a variety of reasons – false or lack 
of identification documents, concerns over 
the validity of a claimed nationality etc. – 
there is clearly a risk that persons represent-
ing a security threat enter the EU. However, 
the challenge for the border guard is clear: 
how to differentiate for example, between 
the asylum seeker who arrives at the exter-
nal border with no papers and the economic 
migrant or a migrant who might pose a se-
curity threat attempting to abuse the system 
by claiming a false nationality? This difficulty 
is clearly exacerbated in situations of intense 
migratory pressure.
It is clear that in response to these chal-
lenges, greater emphasis must be placed on 
increased screening and debriefing teams. 
Second-line checks on arrivals are a crucial 
step in the identification process. They also 
provide an important source of information 
which can be further used for intelligence and 
risk analysis purposes. Improving intelligence 
and analytical capacities are thus also of great 
importance. The development of risk profiles 
of arrivals and training for border guards in-
volved in these areas would also help to en-
sure greater identification.

6.3.  Knowledge management 
at operational and policy 
levels
One improvement which has been evident 
in the preceding years has been the increas-
ing sources of information and data from 
the external borders. Information is key to 
situational monitoring and for analytical 
purposes and so the improved availability 
of information is of significant importance. 
However, with greater information comes 
a greater challenge in effectively utilising it. 
This is especially the case in emergency sit-
uations when large amounts of information 
are available but time is scarce. It is in this 
context that data and situational informa-
tion is sometimes not enough, but authori-
ties will require the analysis and intelligence 
derived from it to make the fully informed 
decisions. The management of this knowl-
edge process is critical.
Methods for ensuring that the available and 
appropriate information reaches the authori-
ties must be assured and must also be able to 
perform even in the context of time pressure. 
The cycle of information is an essential pro-
cess for informed decision making: Ensuring 
that reliable and stable information from the 
screeners, debriefers and all those working on 
the front line is efficiently extracted and then 
analysed by the analytical services and trans-
formed into workable and relevant knowledge 
for onward and timely transmission to deci-
sion makers is crucial. This process supposes 
the existence of capable analytical services 
and timely data collection. Also important in 
this regard is an exchange and sharing ‘cul-
ture’, where relevant information is transmit-
ted amongst differing national and EU services. 
Another aspect of this issue can be seen at 
a higher policy level. It is still unclear how to 
transfer sufficient and relevant information 
and knowledge from border management 
into the articulation of informed and coherent 
migration policies. The knowledge gained by 
border management officials, from the bot-
tom up, should help feed into the devising of 
the higher level strategic policies taken at na-
tional and EU level. The analysis and intelli-
gence should be a constant and reliable source 
when deciding on the future approaches in 
the area of migration management. 
6.4.  Specific third-country 
border management and 
border security risks
Building relations with countries outside the 
EU represents a very important method for 
effectively tackling irregular migration and 
cross-border crime and forms an important 
part of the EU’s Integrated Border Manage-
ment (IBM) concept. Operational coopera-
tion, regional capacity building projects and 
information exchange have all been of huge 
importance in ensuring efficient and effec-
tive border control systems for both the EU 
Member States and their counterparts. How-
ever, in these relations there has, at times, 
been a tendency to address the risks that the 
third countries’ border management circum-
stances represent to the EU borders. For in-
stance, the focus might be overly placed on 
the third countries’ weak capacities, porous 
borders and population movements. It is a le-
gitimate concern but it also can lead to a lack 
of incentive for third countries to cooperate if 
the approach is too EU-centric. The approach 
could be more focused on directly benefitting 
the specific border related needs of those third 
countries. The consequence of this would be 
to assist in improving and enhancing their 
border management in relation to the threats 
and needs of these third countries. 
Identifying the risks faced by third-country 
partners in terms of their border manage-
ment and border security concerns, and then 
recommending local and regional actions for 
risk mitigation would then likely cascade and 
spread out to create reciprocal positive ben-
55 of 68
efits for the EU borders. It would also help to 
ensure increased incentive for cooperation 
with the EU. This could be achieved through 
targeted capability building and technical as-
sistance projects in third countries, based on a 
national appreciation of risk, which would aim 
to strengthen third-country migration man-
agement capacities, whilst, all the while, still 
imparting EU border management standards. 
As an initial proposal, Turkey would appear 
to be a reasonable candidate with whom to 
implement this working method of increased 
and targeted cooperation. This does not pre-
clude the necessity to cooperate with other 
countries of origin and transit who play im-
portant roles and are crucial partners in the 
EU neighbourhood.
6.5.  Multidisciplinary 
integrated training for EU 
border-control authorities
It has been seen in this year’s Annual Risk 
Analysis that the geopolitical environment 
surrounding the EU is becoming ever more 
complex. Given the proximity of conflict ar-
eas to the external borders of the EU, there 
is no doubt that the threat level to EU bor-
der security increases. With the situations 
in certain neighbouring countries constantly 
evolving, sometimes for the worse, so too the 
nature of the challenge for border authori-
ties proves to be constantly shifting. This can 
be seen also in the sudden influxes faced at 
the external borders which have proved dif-
ficult to predict and thus, demand an effec-
tive and timely response. It can be a challenge 
to provide for the continuous functioning of 
border-control activities in a situation where 
thousands of migrants, of mixed backgrounds, 
circumstances and nationalities, arrive at the 
border in a very short space of time. It im-
plies a certain level of inherent risk and vul-
nerability at the external borders.
In response to constantly evolving location 
and scale of the threats witnessed, the au-
thorities at the borders must have a capa-
bility for risk mitigation during moments 
of emergency. Often the response in such 
situations calls for intensified interagency 
cooperation. This is an important tool for 
responding when a particular border is un-
der an inordinate strain. The difficulty that 
this method presents though is that the of-
ficials tasked with working in closer collab-
oration, whether they are from customs, 
security services, asylum authorities, or in-
deed border guards, are not trained to know 
the work of the other. The border guard will 
likely not have the necessary knowledge of 
the customs official’s functions and likewise, 
the police officer will not know all the pro-
cedures of the asylum official’s work – and 
vice versa. This can lead to misunderstand-
ings, difficulties and delays when these au-
thorities are required to assist one another 
during crises. When time is of the essence, 
and a potential humanitarian crisis is unfold-
ing, processes must be as streamlined and as 
dependable as possible.
A potential mitigation for this issue could 
be to complement interagency cooperation 
through an integrated multidisciplinary train-
ing. An integrated training for all officials 
working at the borders would aim to provide 
them with the skills found in one another’s 
respective disciplines. This could comprise 
of specialised courses to enable those un-
dertaking them to gain a knowledge of the 
processes behind the work of their counter-
parts in the field. Ensuring that a border guard 
would be well versed in the work of a law-
enforcement security officer, and have a se-
cure grasp of the issues going into the fight 
against smuggling of weapons, for instance, 
would ensure that in his own work he could 
contribute to the work of the other. A better 
understanding of the needs of the other au-
thorities in the field would certainly lead to 
an enhanced interagency cooperation which 
could help to mitigate the threat arising dur-
ing emergencies at the borders.

The term Member States refers to FRAN 
Member States, which includes the 28 Mem-
ber States and the three Schengen Asso-
ciated Countries (Iceland, Norway and 
Switzerland). For the data concerning de-
tections at the external borders of the EU, 
some of the border types are not applicable 
to all FRAN Member States. This pertains to 
data on all FRAN indicators since the data 
are provided disaggregated by border type. 
The definitions of detections at land bor-
ders are therefore not applicable (excluding 
borders with non-Schengen principalities) 
for Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, 
France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Lux-
embourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portu-
gal, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. For 
Cyprus, the land border refers to the Green 
Line demarcation with the area where the 
Government of the Republic of Cyprus does 
not exercise effective control. For sea bor-
ders, the definitions are not applicable for 
land-locked Member States including Aus-
tria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxem-
bourg, Slovakia and Switzerland.
In addition, data on detections of illegal bor-
der-crossing at land, air and sea BCPs (1B) are 
not available for Iceland, Ireland and Spain, 
and in Greece these detections are included 
in the data for indicator 1A. Data for Nor-
way only include detections of illegal bor-
der-crossing at land and sea BCPs (1B), not 
between BCPs (1A).
Data on detections of illegal border-cross-
ing between sea BCPs (1A) are not availa-
ble for Ireland.
Data on apprehension (FRAN Indicator 2) of 
facilitators are not available for Ireland. For 
Italy, the data are not disaggregated by bor-
der type, but are reported as total appre-
hensions (not specified). Data for Italy and 
Norway also include the facilitation of ille-
gal stay and work. For Romania, the data in-
clude land Intra-EU detections on exit at the 
border with Hungary.
For the data concerning detections of ille-
gal stay (FRAN Indicator 3), data on detec-
tions on exit are not available for Denmark, 
Ireland, Italy, Spain and the UK. For Greece, 
only detections of illegal stayers with false 
documents are reported at the air border as 
detections of illegal stay on exit. Data on de-
tections of illegal stay inland have not been 
available from the Netherlands since 2012.
Data on refusals of entry (FRAN Indicator 4) 
at the external EU borders are not disag-
gregated by reason of refusal for Ireland and 
the UK. Refusals of entry at the Spanish land 
borders at Ceuta and Melilla (without the is-
suance of a refusal form) are reported sepa-
rately and are not included in the presented 
FRAN data.
The data on passenger flow (shared on vol-
untary basis) are not available for Austria, 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Greece, Iceland, Ire-
land, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Sweden and the 
UK. Data on passenger flow at the air bor-
der are not available according to the defi-
nition for Spain. Data at the sea border are 
not available for Spain, the Netherlands, Ro-
mania and Denmark.
For Ireland, data on persons using false doc-
uments are only available from February 2011 
(FRAN Indicator 6). In Sweden, the data on 
false document use are not presented since 
the reported detections do not distinguish be-
tween apprehensions of persons using false 
documents at the external border and those 
apprehended inland.
