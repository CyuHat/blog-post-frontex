          Frontex official publications fall into four main categories: risk analysis, training, operations and
          research, each marked with a distinct graphic identifier. Risk analysis publications bear a trian-
          gular symbol formed by an arrow drawing a triangle, with a dot at the centre. Metaphorically,
          the arrow represents the cyclical nature of risk analysis processes and its orientation towards an
          appropriate operational response. The triangle is a symbol of ideal proportions and knowledge,
          reflecting the pursuit of factual exactness, truth and exhaustive analysis. The dot at the centre
          represents the intelligence factor and the focal point where information from diverse sources
          converges to be processed, systematised and shared as analytical products. Thus, Frontex risk
          analysis is meant to be at the centre and to form a reliable basis for its operational activities.
